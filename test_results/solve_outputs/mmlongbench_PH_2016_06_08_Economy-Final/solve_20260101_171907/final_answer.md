## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identify Hispanic Subgroups and Their Confidence Gains (2008–2015)

To determine which Hispanic subgroup experienced the greatest gain in confidence from 2008 to 2015, we first identify the subgroups explicitly referenced in the available materials and quantify their respective increases in financial optimism during this period.

The report highlights three key Hispanic subgroups based on demographic and educational characteristics:

1. **Hispanics with some college education** — This subgroup recorded the largest absolute increase in confidence, with a **20-percentage-point rise** in optimism about future financial prospects, reaching 85% by 2015 [rag-1].  
2. **Latino men** — This group showed a substantial gain of **18 percentage points** in financial optimism over the same period [rag-1].  
3. **Younger Latinos (under age 30)** — This cohort experienced a **13-percentage-point increase** in confidence [rag-1].

These figures reflect a broad-based recovery in economic sentiment among Hispanic populations following the Great Recession, but the magnitude of improvement varies significantly across subgroups. Notably, educational attainment emerges as the strongest correlate with increased optimism, as those with some college education outperformed both gender and age-based subgroups in terms of absolute gain.

No other subgroups (e.g., by income level, immigration status, or region) are mentioned in the provided materials, limiting our analysis to these three categories.

### Summary  
The Hispanic subgroups analyzed are those with some college education, Latino men, and younger Latinos under age 30. Among them, individuals with some college education demonstrated the highest confidence gain at +20 percentage points, making them the subgroup with the most significant improvement in financial optimism from 2008 to 2015.

## S2: Compare Magnitude of Confidence Gains Across Subgroups

To determine which Hispanic subgroup experienced the largest increase in confidence from 2008 to 2015, we directly compare the absolute percentage-point gains reported for each identified subgroup. The three subgroups under analysis are: Hispanics with some college education, Latino men, and younger Latinos (under age 30). Each of these groups exhibited measurable improvements in financial optimism, but the scale of improvement differs significantly.

- **Hispanics with some college education** showed a **+20-percentage-point increase** in confidence, rising to 85% optimism by 2015 [rag-1].  
- **Latino men** recorded a **+18-percentage-point increase** over the same period [rag-1].  
- **Younger Latinos (under age 30)** experienced a **+13-percentage-point increase** [rag-1].

These gains are not merely relative trends but represent absolute shifts in sentiment, measured as the difference between the proportion of individuals expressing optimism in 2015 versus 2008. The 20-point gain among the college-educated subgroup is not only the highest numerically but also exceeds the next largest gain (18 points) by two full percentage points — a meaningful difference in survey-based sentiment analysis, particularly when sample sizes are large and margins of error are controlled [rag-1].

No other subgroups are referenced in the available materials, and no data suggest a subgroup with a gain exceeding 20 percentage points. The tool execution results further corroborate this finding, explicitly stating that “those with some college education gained the most confidence... with a 20-percentage-point increase, which is the largest among all subgroups mentioned” [rag-1].

Thus, across all measured dimensions, the subgroup with the greatest absolute gain in confidence is unequivocally **Hispanics with some college education**.

### Summary  
Among the three Hispanic subgroups analyzed, those with some college education demonstrated the largest confidence gain (+20 percentage points), surpassing Latino men (+18 points) and younger Latinos (+13 points), confirming them as the subgroup with the most significant improvement in financial optimism from 2008 to 2015.

    From 2008 to 2015, the Hispanic subgroup that gained the most confidence in future financial prospects was those with some college education, who saw a 20-percentage-point increase in optimism, reaching 85% by 2015. Younger Latinos (under age 30) also showed strong gains with a 13-point increase, and Latino men experienced an 18-point rise, but the largest absolute increase was among the more educated subgroup.
