Notably, educational attainment emerges as the strongest correlate with increased optimism, as those with some college education outperformed both gender and age-based subgroups in terms of absolute gain.\n\nNo other subgroups (e.g., by income level, immigration status, or region) are mentioned in the provided materials, limiting our analysis to these three categories.\n\n### Summary  \nThe Hispanic subgroups analyzed are those with some college education, Latino men, and younger Latinos under age 30. Among them, individuals with some college education demonstrated the highest confidence gain at +20 percentage points, making them the subgroup with the most significant improvement in financial optimism from 2008 to 2015.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Compare Magnitude of Confidence Gains Across Subgroups\n\nTo determine which Hispanic subgroup experienced the largest increase in confidence from 2008 to 2015, we directly compare the absolute percentage-point gains reported for each identified subgroup. The three subgroups under analysis are: Hispanics with some college education, Latino men, and younger Latinos (under age 30). Each of these groups exhibited measurable improvements in financial optimism, but the scale of improvement differs significantly.\n\n- **Hispanics with some college education** showed a **+20-percentage-point increase** in confidence, rising to 85% optimism by 2015 [rag-1].  \n- **Latino men** recorded a **+18-percentage-point increase** over the same period [rag-1].  \n- **Younger Latinos (under age 30)** experienced a **+13-percentage-point increase** [rag-1].\n\nThese gains are not merely relative trends but represent absolute shifts in sentiment, measured as the difference between the proportion of individuals expressing optimism in 2015 versus 2008. The 20-point gain among the college-educated subgroup is not only the highest numerically but also exceeds the next largest gain (18 points) by two full percentage points — a meaningful difference in survey-based sentiment analysis, particularly when sample sizes are large and margins of error are controlled [rag-1].\n\nNo other subgroups are referenced in the available materials, and no data suggest a subgroup with a gain exceeding 20 percentage points. The tool execution results further corroborate this finding, explicitly stating that “those with some college education gained the most confidence... with a 20-percentage-point increase, which is the largest among all subgroups mentioned” [rag-1].\n\nThus, across all measured dimensions, the subgroup with the greatest absolute gain in confidence is unequivocally **Hispanics with some college education**.\n\n### Summary  \nAmong the three Hispanic subgroups analyzed, those with some college education demonstrated the largest confidence gain (+20 percentage points), surpassing Latino men (+18 points) and younger Latinos (+13 points), confirming them as the subgroup with the most significant improvement in financial optimism from 2008 to 2015.",
