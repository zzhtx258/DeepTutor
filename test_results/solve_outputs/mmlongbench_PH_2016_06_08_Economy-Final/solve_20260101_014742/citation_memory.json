      "raw_result": "The survey report provides direct numerical data for both \"Foreign-born Latinos\" and \"Latinos interviewed by cellphone,\" without requiring inference.\n\nFor **Foreign-born Latinos**, the report explicitly states:  \n> \"For the full sample, a total of 705 respondents were U.S. born (including Puerto Rico), and 795 were foreign born (excluding Puerto Rico).\"  \nThis definition clarifies that \"foreign born\" refers to persons born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories, and the term is used interchangeably with \"immigrant.\" The exact number of foreign-born Latinos in the sample is **795**.\n\nFor **Latinos interviewed by cellphone**, the report directly reports:  \n> \"The sample consisted of a landline sampling frame (yielding 449 completed interviews) and a cellphone sampling frame (1,051 interviews).\"  \nThus, the number of Latinos interviewed via cellphone is **1,051**.\n\nThese figures are presented as direct counts from the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, which had a total sample size of 1,500 Latino adults. The definitions and numbers are explicitly stated in the Methodology section and corroborated in the table analysis of \"Interviews by Strata\" and the overall sample breakdown.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
