## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identify and Clarify the Population Groups Under Comparison

The survey explicitly defines and provides direct numerical data for the two population groups in question: *foreign-born Latinos* and *Latinos interviewed by cellphone*. According to the report, **foreign-born Latinos** are defined as individuals born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories — a clear and unambiguous demographic classification [rag-1]. The survey reports a total of **795 foreign-born Latinos** within the sample of 1,500 Latino adults [rag-1].

Separately, the survey identifies **1,051 Latinos who were interviewed via cellphone**. This group represents respondents contacted and surveyed using mobile phone methods, which may include individuals who are either U.S.-born or foreign-born — the definition here is based on mode of contact, not place of birth [rag-1]. These numbers are not inferred or estimated; they are directly reported in the Methodology section and corroborated by sample breakdown tables [rag-1].

Importantly, these two groups are not mutually exclusive: a foreign-born Latino may also be among those interviewed by cellphone, and vice versa. However, the survey provides the raw counts for each category independently, allowing for direct numerical comparison without requiring any additional inference or modeling.

Thus, the comparison is straightforward: the survey reports **795 foreign-born Latinos** and **1,051 Latinos interviewed by cellphone**, making the latter group numerically larger in this sample.

### Summary  
The survey provides explicit, direct counts for both groups: 795 foreign-born Latinos and 1,051 Latinos interviewed by cellphone, with no need for inference. The cellphone-interviewed group is larger in this sample.
