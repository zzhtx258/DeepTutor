      "raw_result": "In survey reports such as the Pew Research Center’s *Latinos Increasingly Confident in Personal Finances, See Better Economic Times Ahead* (2016), percentages like “5% of Latinos” are typically interpreted as the proportion of respondents within the surveyed sample who selected a specific response option regarding their perceptions of economic upward mobility for their children. These percentages are derived from nationally representative samples of Latino adults, weighted to reflect the demographic composition of the U.S. Latino population.\n\nFor example, when the report states that 72% of Latinos expect their children to be better off financially than themselves, this figure represents the share of the 1,500 surveyed Latino adults who expressed that specific optimistic view. The remaining percentages—such as 23–24% expecting their children’s financial situation to be “about the same” and 4–6% expecting it to be “less well off”—are mutually exclusive categories that together account for the full distribution of responses. These percentages are not estimates of the total U.S. Latino population but rather statistically adjusted projections based on the survey’s sampling methodology and weighting procedures, which account for factors like age, education, nativity, and geographic distribution.\n\nImportantly, the report clarifies that responses such as “Don’t know/refused” or “Don’t have children/Don’t plan to have children” are excluded from these calculations, ensuring that the percentages reflect only those who provided a clear comparative assessment of their children’s anticipated financial future relative to their own. Thus, a figure like “5%” is interpreted as a precise, data-driven estimate of the proportion of respondents holding a particular view, grounded in rigorous survey design and statistical correction for sampling bias.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

These figures reflect adjusted estimates from survey data (e.g., Pew Research Center, 2016), not direct population counts, and are derived from rigorous weighting for age, education, nativity, and geography.
