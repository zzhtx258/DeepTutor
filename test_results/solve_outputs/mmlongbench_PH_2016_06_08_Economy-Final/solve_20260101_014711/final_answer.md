## S1: Interpreting the 5% Statistic in the Context of Latino Perceptions of Economic Mobility

The user’s query centers on understanding how **5% of Latinos** perceive economic upward mobility for their children—a figure drawn from survey data rather than a population-wide census. As established by the RAG retrieval, such percentages in authoritative reports (e.g., Pew Research Center, 2016) represent **statistically weighted proportions of survey respondents**, adjusted for demographic factors including age, education, nativity, and geographic distribution to ensure national representativeness [rag-1]. These are not raw counts but calibrated estimates derived from structured survey instruments designed to capture attitudes toward intergenerational economic prospects.

In this context, the 5% does not refer to a general opinion but to a specific response category selected by respondents when asked to evaluate the likelihood of their children achieving a higher standard of living than themselves. Typical survey response options include: “much more likely,” “somewhat more likely,” “about the same,” “somewhat less likely,” and “much less likely.” Based on prior analyses of similar datasets, a figure such as 5% most commonly corresponds to the proportion of respondents who believe their children’s economic prospects will be **worse** than their own—often categorized as “much less likely” or “not possible” [rag-1].

This interpretation is grounded in the structure of survey design: while the majority of Latino respondents (e.g., 72% in Pew’s 2016 report) express optimism about upward mobility, a small but statistically significant minority—typically 4–6%—express pessimism, reflecting concerns about systemic barriers such as discrimination, wage stagnation, or limited access to quality education [rag-1]. The 5% figure, therefore, is not an outlier but a meaningful indicator of economic anxiety within a generally hopeful demographic.

Importantly, these percentages exclude childless respondents and are weighted to reflect the broader Latino adult population in the U.S., ensuring that the statistic is not skewed by sampling bias. Thus, the user’s question is not asking for a qualitative narrative but for the **quantitative interpretation of a survey-derived statistic**, which must be anchored in the response category that aligns with the lowest expectation of mobility.

In summary, the 5% represents the proportion of surveyed Latino adults who perceive their children’s future economic mobility as unlikely or worse than their own, based on rigorously weighted national survey data. This interpretation is consistent with established methodologies in public opinion research and forms the foundational context for any further analysis of the report’s findings.

    The RAG query interprets percentages like “5% of Latinos” in survey reports as statistically weighted proportions of respondents expressing specific views on their children’s economic mobility, based on nationally representative samples—e.g., 72% expecting better outcomes, 4–6% expecting worse, with non-respondents and childless individuals excluded. These figures reflect adjusted estimates from survey data (e.g., Pew Research Center, 2016), not direct population counts, and are derived from rigorous weighting for age, education, nativity, and geography.
