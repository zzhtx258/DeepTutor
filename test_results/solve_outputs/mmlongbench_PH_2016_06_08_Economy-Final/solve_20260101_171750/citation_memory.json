      "raw_result": "The 2015 National Survey of Latinos, conducted by the Pew Research Center, included a nationally representative sample of 1,500 Latino adults, with 795 respondents identified as foreign-born (excluding Puerto Rico). This subgroup constituted 53% of the total sample, reflecting the demographic composition of the U.S. Latino population at the time. The survey employed a dual-frame telephone design—combining landline and cellular samples—to ensure broad coverage, with oversampling in areas with higher densities of Latino residents to improve representation.\n\nThe foreign-born subgroup was analyzed separately from U.S.-born Latinos (including Puerto Rico, n=705), allowing for comparisons on key economic and social indicators. For instance, both foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinos showed similar levels of optimism about their family’s financial future in 2015, with 81% in each group expecting improvement in the coming year. Additionally, 75% of foreign-born adults expected their children to be better off financially than themselves, compared to 70% of U.S.-born adults.\n\nThe survey methodology accounted for potential sampling biases through multistage weighting, using data from the 2013 American Community Survey to adjust for geographic and demographic imbalances, including the oversampling of areas with higher Latino population density and the use of surname-based strata in landline sampling. These adjustments ensured that findings for the foreign-born subgroup could be generalized to the broader U.S. foreign-born Latino population.\n\nThe survey was conducted in both English and Spanish, with 45% of respondents interviewed in Spanish, ensuring accessibility for non-English-dominant foreign-born Latinos. The margin of error for the foreign-born subgroup was ±4.4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level, slightly higher than the overall sample due to its smaller size.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

      "content": "In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos by the Pew Research Center, 795 out of 1,500 Latino adults interviewed were identified as foreign-born, making up 53% of the sample. This means the number of foreign-born Latinos surveyed was greater than the number of U.S.-born Latinos (705). The survey included both landline and cellphone respondents, but the question does not compare foreign-born Latinos to a separate group of Latinos interviewed only by cellphone; rather, cellphone interviews were part of the overall dual-frame methodology used to reach the entire sample, including the foreign-born subgroup.",

      "raw_result": "The 2015 National Survey of Latinos, conducted by the Pew Research Center, included a total of 1,500 Latino adult respondents interviewed via both landline and cellular telephones. Of these, 1,051 interviews were conducted using cellphone sampling frames. This cellphone sample was part of a dual-frame design that also included 449 landline interviews, ensuring broader coverage of the Latino population, including those who rely exclusively on mobile phones.\n\nThe cellphone sample was stratified based on the share of Latinos in the telephone area code, with interviews distributed across high, medium, and low strata. The use of a cellphone frame was critical to capturing a representative sample, especially given the increasing reliance on mobile phones among Latino populations, particularly among younger and foreign-born adults.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
