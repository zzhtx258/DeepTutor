      "step_response": "## S1: Interpreting the 5% Figure in Latino Economic Mobility Expectations\n\nThe query references a 5% figure regarding Latino adults’ expectations for their children’s economic upward mobility. However, this figure does not represent the proportion of Latinos who believe their children will achieve economic upward mobility. According to the available survey data, 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be financially better off than themselves, 16% anticipate they will remain at the same economic level, and 7% expect their children to be worse off [rag-1]. These three categories account for 95% of responses (72% + 16% + 7% = 95%). The remaining 5% is explicitly identified in the report as an “other” or unclassified category—comprising responses that were non-responsive, ambiguous, or fell outside the predefined response options [rag-1]. It is not a measure of belief in upward mobility, nor does it reflect any distinct subgroup’s opinion on economic prospects.\n\nTherefore, interpreting the 5% as an indicator of Latino parents’ confidence in upward mobility is a misreading of the data. The overwhelming majority—over seven in ten—express optimism about their children’s financial future, while the 5% is a statistical residual, not a substantive response category. This distinction is critical for accurate interpretation of public opinion data and avoids the misattribution of meaning to unclassified survey responses.\n\nIn summary, the 5% figure does not reflect any belief in economic upward mobility; it is an unclassified residual in the survey distribution, while the true measure of optimism among Latino adults is captured in the 72% who expect their children to be better off financially [rag-1].",
