## Concise Answer

The 5% figure does not represent Latinos who see economic upward mobility for their children; it is an unclassified response category. The correct proportion expecting upward mobility is 72%.

However, the question asks: *“How do 5% of the Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children?”*

Based on the analysis, **5% do not see economic upward mobility** — they are in the “other” or unclassified category, meaning their response was not about upward mobility at all.

Thus, the precise answer is:

**They do not see economic upward mobility for their children.**

## Detailed Answer

## S1: Interpreting the 5% Figure in Latino Economic Mobility Expectations

The query references a claim that “5% of Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children.” However, this interpretation is incorrect based on the available survey data. According to the 2015 National Survey data cited in the materials, Latino adults’ expectations for their children’s financial future are distributed as follows: 72% expect their children to be *better off* financially than themselves, 16% expect them to be *about the same*, and 7% expect them to be *worse off* [rag-1]. These three categories account for 95% of responses, leaving a residual 5% classified as “other” or unclassified — a category typically used for non-responses, refusals, or ambiguous answers that do not fit the predefined response options [rag-1].

Crucially, this 5% does *not* represent individuals who believe their children will experience economic upward mobility. Rather, it is a statistical artifact of survey design, capturing responses that were not clearly assignable to any of the three primary mobility categories. To misinterpret this 5% as a measure of upward mobility expectation would be a fundamental misreading of the data structure and a distortion of the actual sentiment expressed by Latino families.

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the overwhelming majority — 72% — of Latino adults express optimism about their children’s economic prospects, while the 5% figure is unrelated to mobility expectations and instead reflects survey non-classification.

In summary, the 5% figure mentioned in the query is not an indicator of economic upward mobility expectations; it is an unclassified response category. The true proportion of Latino adults who expect upward mobility for their children is 72%, not 5%.

    There is no evidence that 5% of Latinos report seeing economic upward mobility for their children. The data show that 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially, 16% expect the same, and 7% expect worse. The 5% figure mentioned in one chart refers to an unclassified or 'other' category, not a reported belief about upward mobility.
