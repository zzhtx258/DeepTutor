      "raw_result": "The provided context does not indicate that 5% of Latinos report anything specific about economic upward mobility for their children. Instead, the data consistently show that 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially than themselves, as reported in the 2015 National Survey of Latinos by the Pew Research Center. An additional 16% expect their children’s financial situation to be about the same as theirs, and 7% expect their children to be less well off. \n\nOne visual reference notes a small uncolored segment of 4% or 5% in a chart, but this is described as an unreported or “other” category—not a direct response to the question of economic mobility. The 5% figure does not represent a reported percentage of Latinos who believe their children will have upward economic mobility; rather, it appears to be an unclassified or non-response category in one chart’s design.\n\nTherefore, there is no evidence in the context that 5% of Latinos report economic upward mobility for their children.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
