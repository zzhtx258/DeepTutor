      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Chapter 2.2 Content Regarding Museums in Bergen\n\nBased on a comprehensive review of all available materials — including six distinct RAG queries and tool execution results — there is no evidence that **Chapter 2.2** of any brochure (including *BergenGuide 2022* or *The Bergen Guide*) introduces or discusses museums in Bergen.\n\nWhile the knowledge base references several museums in Bergen — such as Bryggens Museum, Kode Art Museums of Bergen, and Edvard Grieg’s House — none are explicitly linked to **Chapter 2.2** [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3][rag-4][rag-5][rag-6]. Furthermore, the only chapters mentioned in the context are:\n\n- Chapter 4: Shopping\n- Chapter 5: Restaurants\n- Chapter 8.2: Not fully specified, but unrelated to museums\n\nNo document chunk, reference, or metadata confirms the existence or content of Chapter 2.2 in relation to museums. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how many museums — if any — are introduced in this section.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe question is **Not answerable** based on the current set of available documents. There is no information linking Chapter 2.2 of any brochure to museums in Bergen, nor is there any indication that such a chapter exists within the referenced guides. Further documentation or access to the actual brochure would be required to provide an accurate response.",
