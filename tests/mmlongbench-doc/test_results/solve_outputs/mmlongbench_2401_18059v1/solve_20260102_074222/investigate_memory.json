The **horizontal axis (x-axis)** represents the different configurations of retrieval strategies, specifically: tree traversal with top-k values of 5, 10, and 20, and collapsed tree with context lengths of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 tokens. The **vertical axis (y-axis)** measures the F1 score, which indicates retrieval effectiveness, and ranges from approximately 0.45 to 0.58.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",
