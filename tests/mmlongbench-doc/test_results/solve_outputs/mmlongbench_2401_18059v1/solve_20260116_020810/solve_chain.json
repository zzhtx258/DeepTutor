      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Node Color Information in Figure 1 for Multi-Cluster Nodes\n\nTo address the question regarding the color of nodes that appear in more than one cluster in Figure 1, a comprehensive review of all available materials — including knowledge base citations and tool execution results — was conducted. The objective of this step is to determine whether such visual information is explicitly documented or can be inferred from the provided context.\n\nThe context consistently describes **Figure 1** as a diagram illustrating the RAPTOR tree construction process, composed of three panels that explain hierarchical node formation and clustering mechanisms [rag-1]–[rag-6]. While the concept of “soft clustering” is mentioned — which allows nodes to belong to multiple clusters — there is no reference to any visual encoding (such as color, shape, or border style) used to represent multi-cluster membership [rag-6].\n\nFurthermore, multiple independent queries targeting the specific visual attribute — node color — yielded identical conclusions: no information exists in the documents regarding the colors of nodes, let alone those appearing in more than one cluster. The absence of such data is not due to insufficient search depth (six distinct RAG queries were executed), nor is it attributable to ambiguity in interpretation — the materials simply do not contain the requested visual metadata.\n\nIn summary, based on the exhaustive review of all available documentation:\n\n> **The color information of nodes appearing in more than one cluster in Figure 1 is not available in the provided documents.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by consistent findings across all six RAG queries and the final tool execution result, which collectively confirm the absence of any description or specification of node colors or visual indicators for multi-cluster membership in Figure 1.",
