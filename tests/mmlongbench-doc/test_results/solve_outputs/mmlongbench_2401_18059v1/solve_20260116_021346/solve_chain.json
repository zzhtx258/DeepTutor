      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Step 5 in Tree Traversal Method\n\nThe pseudo code corresponding to **Step 5** of the tree traversal method cannot be directly extracted from the available materials because **Appendix F does not label algorithm steps numerically** [rag-1]. The pseudocode for Algorithm 1 (Tree Traversal Algorithm) is formally documented in Appendix F of the RAPTOR paper, but the provided context does not reproduce the line-by-line code or assign explicit step numbers such as “Step 5” to specific lines or phases [rag-4].\n\nHowever, based on conceptual reconstruction from the algorithm’s operational structure, **Step 5 corresponds to the output phase** of the traversal process. This phase occurs after recursive traversal and top-k node selection per layer, and it involves returning a set of relevant nodes across layers that best match the query contextually [rag-5]. In essence, Step 5 represents the termination and result aggregation stage — where the algorithm concludes its descent through the tree (either at leaf nodes or upon reaching a predefined depth/token limit) and outputs the selected nodes for downstream use.\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the described workflow:\n1. Initialize traversal at the root.\n2. Compute dot-product similarity between query vector and node embeddings per layer.\n3. Select top-$k$ nodes per layer.\n4. Recursively continue traversal until termination conditions are met.\n5. **Return the accumulated set of contextually relevant nodes** — this is Step 5.\n\nWhile the exact pseudo code for this step is not isolatable due to lack of numerical labeling in Appendix F, its functional role is clearly defined within the broader algorithmic framework.\n\nIn summary, although we cannot quote a specific block of pseudo code labeled “Step 5,” we can confidently identify its conceptual function as the **output generation phase** following recursive traversal and node selection. For the complete, line-numbered pseudocode, direct reference to Appendix F of the RAPTOR documentation is required [rag-4][rag-5].",
