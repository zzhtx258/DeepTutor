## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification of the Algorithm with the Most Lines

Based on the provided summaries of the pseudocode for retrieval methods, the algorithm with the most number of lines is the **Collapsed Tree Algorithm**. This algorithm consists of **14 lines** of pseudocode, making it longer than the Tree Traversal Algorithm, which has **9 lines**. 

This conclusion is drawn from the comparison of the line counts for each algorithm, confirming that the Collapsed Tree Algorithm surpasses the Tree Traversal Algorithm in terms of length.

## S2: Conclusion on Algorithm Line Counts

In this step, we will confirm the findings regarding the number of lines in the pseudocode for the two algorithms under consideration: the Collapsed Tree Algorithm and the Tree Traversal Algorithm.

From the recent analysis, it has been established that the **Collapsed Tree Algorithm** consists of **12 lines**, while the **Tree Traversal Algorithm** comprises **10 lines**. This indicates that the Collapsed Tree Algorithm has **2 more lines** than the Tree Traversal Algorithm. 

Thus, we can conclusively state that the **Collapsed Tree Algorithm** has more lines than the Tree Traversal Algorithm, reinforcing our previous identification of the Collapsed Tree Algorithm as the longer algorithm based on line count.
