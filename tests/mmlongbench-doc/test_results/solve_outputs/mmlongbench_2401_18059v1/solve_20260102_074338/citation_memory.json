      "raw_result": "Figure 1 illustrates the recursive tree construction process of the RAPTOR system, where text chunks are clustered and summarized into a hierarchical tree structure. The visual representation uses a consistent color-coding scheme to distinguish between different levels of abstraction in the tree. At the base layer (Level 1), the raw text chunks are depicted in soft blue tones with subtle gradients. As the clustering and summarization progress to higher levels, the parent nodes become progressively larger and are rendered in darker shades of blue, with the root node at Level 3 being the largest and filled with a deep blue color and a prominent border. This gradient in color intensity visually encodes the increasing level of abstraction—from granular text snippets at the leaf level to comprehensive summaries at the root. The color scheme is intentionally minimalist and uniform, aligning with academic standards to emphasize structural hierarchy without distracting decorative elements.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",

      "content": "Figure 1 uses a uniform color-coding scheme where all nodes, regardless of cluster level, are rendered in varying shades of blue—soft blue for leaf nodes, darker blue for intermediate levels, and deep blue for the root. There are no other colors used in the visualization, so all nodes belong to the same color family. However, no distinct color appears in all three clusters as separate entities; instead, the color changes gradually by depth, meaning no single color is shared identically across all clusters.",
