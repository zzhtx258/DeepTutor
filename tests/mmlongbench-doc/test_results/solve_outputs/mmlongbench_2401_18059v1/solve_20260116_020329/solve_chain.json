      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Pseudocode Length Comparison Between Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2\n\nThe available materials confirm that the complete pseudocode for both **Algorithm 1 (Tree Traversal)** and **Algorithm 2 (Collapsed Tree)** is formally presented in **Appendix F** of the referenced RAPTOR documentation [rag-1]. However, none of the provided knowledge items reproduce the actual pseudocode text or provide line-by-line counts for either algorithm.\n\nWhile one summary suggests that Tree Traversal “typically requires more lines of code” due to its recursive, layer-by-layer structure compared to the flattened, single-pass nature of Collapsed Tree [rag-1], this is an inference based on structural complexity—not a measured line count. The document does not quantify this difference numerically, nor does it offer any direct comparison metric such as total lines, statements, or indentation levels.\n\nMultiple queries specifically targeting line counts or pseudocode length for either algorithm returned no usable data [rag-2, rag-3, rag-4, rag-5, rag-6, rag-7, rag-8]. Even when asking for the full pseudocode text from Appendix F, the system consistently reports that the actual code lines are not included in the available materials.\n\nTherefore, while qualitative descriptions imply greater complexity in Algorithm 1, **no definitive answer can be given regarding which algorithm has more lines**, because the necessary quantitative data (exact line counts) is absent from all available sources.\n\n### Summary\nBased on the current evidence, it is not possible to determine which algorithm—Tree Traversal or Collapsed Tree—has more lines of pseudocode, as the required line-count data is not present in the available materials. Any claim about relative length would be speculative without access to Appendix F’s actual pseudocode content.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Inference Based on Structural Complexity\n\nAlthough exact line counts for **Algorithm 1 (Tree Traversal)** and **Algorithm 2 (Collapsed Tree)** are not available in the provided materials, we can reasonably infer which algorithm likely contains more lines of pseudocode by analyzing their described structural complexity.\n\nAccording to the summary in [rag-1], **Tree Traversal** involves *recursive layer-by-layer processing with per-layer selection*. This implies multiple nested control structures — such as loops over tree levels, conditional checks for node selection, and recursive calls — each contributing additional lines to the pseudocode. Recursive algorithms typically require explicit base cases, recursive calls, and state management, all of which increase line count.\n\nIn contrast, **Collapsed Tree** is described as flattening the tree structure and performing a *single global scoring pass*. This suggests a more linear, iterative approach without recursion or multi-level branching. A single-pass algorithm generally requires fewer lines because it avoids the overhead of managing recursion depth, maintaining intermediate states across layers, or handling complex traversal logic.\n\nTherefore, based on the qualitative description of operational structure:\n\n> **Algorithm 1 (Tree Traversal)** is inferred to have more lines of pseudocode than **Algorithm 2 (Collapsed Tree)** due to its inherently more complex, recursive, and layered design.\n\nThis inference aligns with general software engineering principles: algorithms with deeper nesting, recursion, and state-dependent branching tend to be longer in code length than those using flat, sequential, or single-pass logic — even if both achieve similar functional outcomes.\n\n### Summary\nWhile no exact line counts are provided, the structural description in [rag-1] strongly supports the conclusion that **Tree Traversal (Algorithm 1)** likely has more lines of pseudocode than **Collapsed Tree (Algorithm 2)**, owing to its recursive, multi-layered nature versus the latter’s simplified, flattened execution model.",
