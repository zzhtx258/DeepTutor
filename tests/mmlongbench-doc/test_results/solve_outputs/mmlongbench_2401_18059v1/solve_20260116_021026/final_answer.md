## Detailed Answer

## S1: Analysis of Node Colors Across Clusters in Figure 1

To determine whether the colors of nodes appearing in all three clusters in Figure 1 can be identified, we conducted a comprehensive review of all available materials, including multiple RAG queries and tool execution results. The goal was to extract any explicit or implicit information regarding node coloring patterns or shared nodes across clusters.

However, after examining six distinct RAG query results (`[rag-1]` through `[rag-6]`) and reviewing the associated raw text, it is evident that **no information exists** about:

- The specific colors assigned to nodes in Figure 1;
- Whether any nodes are shared across all three clusters;
- Any visual or textual description of node attributes such as color, shape, or label within the context of cluster overlap.

The only consistent description provided across all materials is that Figure 1 illustrates the RAPTOR tree construction process using three panels — but no further visual or semantic details about node coloring or clustering overlap are given.

Additionally, no code execution or image generation was performed in this step, and no artifacts were produced that could supplement the textual analysis.

### Conclusion

Based on the strict requirement to derive answers solely from available materials — and after verifying that no partial data, inference, or calculation can yield the requested information — we conclude that the question is **not answerable** with current resources.

This conclusion aligns with the high bar for “Not answerable” as defined: the base data is genuinely missing, multiple searches returned completely unrelated content, and no clues exist that could lead to an answer.
