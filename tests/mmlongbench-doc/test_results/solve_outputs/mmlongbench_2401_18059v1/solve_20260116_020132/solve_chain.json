      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of Common Nodes Retrieved by RAPTOR in Figure 4\n\nIn the context of RAPTOR’s tree-based retrieval mechanism as illustrated in **Figure 4**, the system dynamically selects nodes based on the semantic and structural demands of each query. For the two distinct questions posed — one thematic (“What is the central theme of the story?”) and one multi-hop — RAPTOR retrieves overlapping intermediate nodes while diverging in higher-level node inclusion.\n\nSpecifically, for **both questions**, RAPTOR retrieves the following intermediate nodes:  \n**Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19** [rag-1].\n\nThese nodes represent shared contextual or narrative segments that are relevant to answering either question. However, for the multi-hop question (Question 2), RAPTOR additionally retrieves **root summary node 25**, which provides broader summarization context not required for the thematic question [rag-1]. This divergence highlights RAPTOR’s adaptive retrieval strategy: it minimizes redundancy by selecting only the necessary nodes for each query type, while preserving common ground through shared intermediate nodes.\n\nThus, the set of nodes retrieved for *both* questions is precisely:  \n$$\n\\{16, 17, 18, 19\\}\n$$\n\nThis result is consistent across both the summarized explanation and the raw textual confirmation provided in the available materials [rag-1].\n\n### Summary\nRAPTOR retrieves nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19 for both questions in Figure 4, forming the core shared retrieval set. The additional retrieval of node 25 for the multi-hop question underscores RAPTOR’s ability to scale retrieval depth according to query complexity.",
