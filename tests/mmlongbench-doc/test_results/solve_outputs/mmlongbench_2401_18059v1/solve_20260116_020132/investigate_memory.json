      "raw_result": "In **Figure 4**, which illustrates RAPTOR’s tree-based retrieval process for two questions about the Cinderella story, the system retrieves different sets of nodes depending on the nature of each question:\n\n- **For Question 1 (“What is the central theme of the story?”)** — a *thematic question* requiring holistic understanding — RAPTOR selects **intermediate nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19**. These nodes represent summarized content from higher layers of the hierarchical tree, enabling RAPTOR to provide broader contextual answers that capture overarching narrative elements.\n\n- **For Question 2 (“How did Cinderella find a happy ending?”)** — a *multi-hop question* requiring synthesis across narrative segments — RAPTOR retrieves **root summary node 25** along with the same **intermediate nodes (16, 17, 18, and 19)**. This combination allows RAPTOR to access both high-level thematic summaries and mid-level contextual abstractions necessary to reconstruct the narrative resolution.\n\nThese selections contrast with those made by the **DPR retriever**, which only retrieves leaf nodes (Layer 0), typically missing the synthesized context provided by intermediate and root nodes. RAPTOR’s ability to adaptively select nodes across multiple layers — from leaf to root — enables it to better match the granularity required by each query type.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Figure 4\n- [2] RAPTOR_Tree_Retrieval_Diagram_Figure_4 (image)\n- [3] Question 1\n- [4] Question 2\n- [5] Intermediate Nodes",
      "summary": "In Figure 4, RAPTOR retrieves intermediate nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19 for both questions. For Question 1 (thematic), it selects only these intermediate nodes. For Question 2 (multi-hop), it additionally retrieves root summary node 25. Thus, the common nodes retrieved for both questions are 16, 17, 18, and 19.",
