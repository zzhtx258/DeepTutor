## Detailed Answer

## S1: Assessing Availability of Information for Node Color Analysis in Figure 1

To determine whether nodes appearing in more than one cluster are colored in a distinguishable manner in Figure 1, we must first establish whether sufficient information about node colors and cluster memberships is available. The question hinges on two critical data elements: (1) the visual representation of node colors in the figure, and (2) the explicit mapping of nodes to multiple clusters.

However, all available materials consistently indicate that no such information is accessible. The query results for “Figure 1” return empty or null responses, with no embedded description of node colors, cluster assignments, or legend details [query-1], [query-2]. Even the RAG-based retrieval, which specifically searched for visualizations of nodes overlapping clusters in the RAPTOR paper, confirms that while Figure 1 is described as a schematic of recursive tree construction using text chunks from *Cinderella*, it contains no explicit color coding for overlapping nodes or cluster boundaries [rag-1]. Furthermore, no tool execution or image artifacts were generated or provided to supplement this textual gap.

Since the color of a node in a cluster visualization is a perceptual attribute that must be explicitly encoded in the figure—either through a legend, caption, or direct annotation—and no such encoding is documented or available, it is impossible to identify which colors correspond to nodes in multiple clusters. Without this foundational visual metadata, any attempt to answer the original question would be speculative and unsupported by evidence.

In summary, the necessary information to determine the colors of nodes appearing in more than one cluster in Figure 1 is not available in any of the provided sources. The question cannot be answered with the current data.
