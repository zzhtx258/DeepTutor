While Figure 1 is described in detail as a schematic diagram illustrating the recursive tree construction process using text chunks from the Cinderella story, the analysis notes that nodes are color-coded in \"soft blue tones with subtle gradients\" to suggest uniformity in source material, but it does not specify distinct colors for different clusters or provide a legend or mapping for cluster-based coloring. Additionally, no other document chunks reference color distinctions for clustering visualization in Figure 1.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine how multiple clusters are visually differentiated by color in Figure 1.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",
