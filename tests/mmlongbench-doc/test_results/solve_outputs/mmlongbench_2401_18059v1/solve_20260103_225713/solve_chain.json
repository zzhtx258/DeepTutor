This color scheme is indicative of the soft clustering methodology employed in RAPTOR, which allows for nodes to belong to multiple clusters simultaneously. The use of soft blue tones visually emphasizes the overlapping nature of these nodes, highlighting their multifaceted relationships within the data structure.\n\nThis representation not only aids in the visual differentiation of nodes but also reinforces the concept of soft clustering, where membership in clusters is not strictly binary but rather allows for degrees of association. Thus, the soft blue tones serve as a clear visual cue for identifying nodes that are integral to multiple clusters, facilitating a better understanding of the underlying data dynamics.",
