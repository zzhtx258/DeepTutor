This visual representation indicates that these nodes can belong to multiple clusters due to the use of soft clustering in RAPTOR's methodology. Each cluster is formed by grouping related content, thereby reflecting shared themes or details across different text segments. \n\nIf you are looking for a specific analysis of the clusters or the significance of these shared nodes in the context of the RAPTOR framework, please let me know!\n\n### References\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",
