      "raw_result": "The clustering algorithm used in RAPTOR is based on **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**. This approach provides a probabilistic framework for grouping text segments into cohesive clusters, allowing nodes to belong to multiple clusters simultaneously—a feature known as soft clustering. This flexibility is essential because individual text segments often contain information relevant to multiple topics, warranting their inclusion in several summaries.\n\nGMMs assume that data points (in this case, text segment embeddings) are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. For a set of $N$ text segments, each represented as a $d$-dimensional dense vector embedding, the likelihood of a text vector $\\mathbf{x}$ belonging to the $k^{th}$ Gaussian distribution is denoted by $P(\\mathbf{x} | k) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}; \\mu_k, \\pmb{\\Sigma}_k)$. The overall probability distribution is a weighted combination: $P(\\mathbf{x}) \\doteq \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_k \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}; \\mu_k, \\pmb{\\Sigma}_k)$, where $\\pi_k$ represents the mixture weight for the $k^{th}$ Gaussian.\n\nTo address the challenges of high-dimensional vector embeddings—where traditional distance metrics may perform poorly—RAPTOR employs **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)** for dimensionality reduction. UMAP balances the preservation of local and global structures by adjusting the number of nearest neighbors parameter ($n_{neighbors}$). The algorithm uses a two-step clustering process: first identifying global clusters, then performing local clustering within them, thereby capturing both broad themes and fine-grained details.\n\nThe optimal number of clusters is determined using the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**, which balances model complexity and goodness of fit. Once the number of clusters is selected, the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm** estimates the GMM parameters: means ($\\mu_k$), covariances ($\\pmb{\\Sigma}_k$), and mixture weights ($\\pi_k$).\n\nAlthough the Gaussian assumption may not perfectly align with the sparse and skewed nature of text data, empirical results indicate that GMM clustering outperforms alternatives such as contiguous chunking, as demonstrated in ablation studies.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",
      "summary": "The clustering algorithm in the paper is based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which provide a probabilistic soft clustering framework where text segments can belong to multiple clusters. This is particularly useful for text data, as segments often relate to multiple topics. A key challenge is that the Gaussian assumption does not perfectly align with the sparse and skewed nature of text embeddings, though empirical results still show GMMs outperform alternatives like contiguous chunking. To mitigate issues with high-dimensional embeddings, the method uses UMAP for dimensionality reduction and selects the optimal number of clusters using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), with parameters estimated via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.",
