The specific colors identified are:\n\n- **Layer 1 Nodes**: Soft blue\n- **Layer 2 Nodes**: Slightly darker blue\n- **Layer 3 Node**: Deep blue (the root node)\n\nThus, the enumeration of the colors of nodes that appear in all three clusters can be summarized in the following list:\n\n- **Soft blue**\n- **Slightly darker blue**\n- **Deep blue**\n\nThis list reflects the distinct color coding used to represent different layers within the hierarchical structure, allowing for clear differentiation among the nodes based on their level of abstraction.",
