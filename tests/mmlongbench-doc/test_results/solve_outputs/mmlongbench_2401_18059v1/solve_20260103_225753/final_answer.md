## S1: Enumeration of Node Colors in All Three Clusters

In Figure 1, the colors of the nodes that appear in all three clusters are indicative of their levels of abstraction within the tree structure of the RAPTOR system. The specific colors identified are:

- **Layer 1 Nodes**: Soft blue
- **Layer 2 Nodes**: Slightly darker blue
- **Layer 3 Node**: Deep blue (the root node)

Thus, the enumeration of the colors of nodes that appear in all three clusters can be summarized in the following list:

- **Soft blue**
- **Slightly darker blue**
- **Deep blue**

This list reflects the distinct color coding used to represent different layers within the hierarchical structure, allowing for clear differentiation among the nodes based on their level of abstraction.

## S2: Integration of Identified Node Colors

In Figure 1, the colors of the nodes that appear in all three clusters have been identified as follows:

- **Layer 0 (leaf nodes)**: Dark Blue
- **Layer 1**: Medium Blue
- **Layer 2**: Light Blue

These colors represent different hierarchical layers within the RAPTOR tree structure, illustrating the levels of abstraction and content summarization.

Thus, the compiled list of colors for the nodes that appear in all three clusters is:

- **Dark Blue**
- **Medium Blue**
- **Light Blue**

This enumeration effectively captures the distinct colors associated with the nodes across the specified clusters, providing clarity on their hierarchical representation within the RAPTOR system.
