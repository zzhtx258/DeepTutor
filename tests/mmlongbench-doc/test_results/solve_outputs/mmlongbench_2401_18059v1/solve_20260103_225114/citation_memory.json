      "raw_result": "Figure 4 illustrates the RAPTOR retrieval process for two questions related to the Cinderella story:\n\n1. **What is the central theme of the story?**\n2. **How did Cinderella find a happy ending?**\n\nFor these questions, RAPTOR selects nodes that primarily come from the **intermediate and root layers** of the hierarchical tree. The highlighted nodes in Figure 4 indicate RAPTOR's choices, which emphasize thematic content and broader context rather than granular, low-level details that a method like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) would typically focus on.\n\nSpecifically, the nodes retrieved by RAPTOR encompass the following:\n\n- **Higher-level summaries** that capture the overarching themes, such as 'courage, resilience, transformation.'\n- More detailed plot information, including critical events such as Cinderella attending the ball and finding the glass slipper. \n\nThis hierarchical summarization allows RAPTOR to aggregate relevant information across different levels in the tree, thus enabling it to effectively answer multi-hop questions by integrating insights from various layers rather than retrieving isolated text fragments like DPR does.\n\nThe core takeaway from the figure is that RAPTOR's ability to retrieve from various layers helps in synthesizing complex inquiries about narrative structure and thematic coherence, enhancing the quality of the response to the specified questions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",
