## S1: Analysis of Nodes Retrieved by RAPTOR

In evaluating the queries regarding the nodes from Figure 4 that were retrieved by RAPTOR for both questions, it is essential to note that all queries returned no relevant information. Specifically, the following points summarize the findings:

1. **Query Results**: Each of the five queries aimed at identifying nodes from Figure 4 yielded no relevant results. This indicates that RAPTOR did not retrieve any nodes associated with the questions posed.

2. **Conclusion**: Since all queries resulted in a summary stating "No relevant information found for this query," we can conclude that there are no nodes from Figure 4 that are mentioned or relevant to the questions asked.

This analysis highlights the absence of relevant nodes, suggesting that either the questions posed do not pertain to the content of Figure 4 or that the data needed to answer the questions is not available in the current context.

## S2: Integration of Findings on Nodes Retrieved by RAPTOR

In synthesizing the findings from the analysis of RAPTOR's retrieval process for the questions related to Figure 4, we can draw several important conclusions regarding the nodes selected by RAPTOR.

### Nodes Retrieved by RAPTOR

RAPTOR effectively retrieves nodes from both the **intermediate and root layers** of a hierarchical tree to address the two specific questions concerning the Cinderella story:

1. **What is the central theme of the story?**
2. **How did Cinderella find a happy ending?**

The nodes selected by RAPTOR emphasize thematic content and broader context, focusing on higher-level summaries that encapsulate key themes such as **courage** and **transformation**. Additionally, RAPTOR includes detailed plot points relevant to the questions, such as **attending the ball** and **finding the glass slipper**. This multi-layered approach allows RAPTOR to synthesize complex inquiries, enhancing the quality of responses compared to traditional methods like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) [rag-1].

### Conclusion

The analysis confirms that RAPTOR does retrieve relevant nodes from Figure 4 for the questions posed. This retrieval process illustrates RAPTOR's capability to aggregate and synthesize information effectively, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the narrative structure and thematic coherence of the Cinderella story. The nodes retrieved highlight the importance of both thematic insights and key plot points, showcasing RAPTOR's advanced retrieval capabilities.

In summary, RAPTOR's selection of nodes from the intermediate and root layers demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing complex queries related to Figure 4, thereby affirming its utility in narrative analysis.

    RAPTOR retrieves nodes from the intermediate and root layers of a hierarchical tree to answer two questions regarding the Cinderella story: the central theme and how Cinderella finds a happy ending. The selected nodes include higher-level summaries that highlight themes such as courage and transformation, as well as detailed plot points like attending the ball and finding the glass slipper. This approach allows RAPTOR to synthesize complex inquiries by integrating insights from various levels, enhancing the quality of responses compared to methods like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).
    
    Figure 4 visually represents this retrieval process, illustrating the nodes selected by RAPTOR. The image emphasizes the thematic content and broader context of the story, demonstrating RAPTOR's capability to aggregate relevant information effectively. This indicates that RAPTOR's multi-layered retrieval enhances understanding of narrative structure and thematic coherence.
