Specifically, the following points summarize the findings:\n\n1. **Query Results**: Each of the five queries aimed at identifying nodes from Figure 4 yielded no relevant results. This indicates that RAPTOR did not retrieve any nodes associated with the questions posed.\n\n2. **Conclusion**: Since all queries resulted in a summary stating \"No relevant information found for this query,\" we can conclude that there are no nodes from Figure 4 that are mentioned or relevant to the questions asked.\n\nThis analysis highlights the absence of relevant nodes, suggesting that either the questions posed do not pertain to the content of Figure 4 or that the data needed to answer the questions is not available in the current context.",

The highlighted nodes in Figure 4 indicate RAPTOR's choices, which emphasize thematic content and broader context rather than granular, low-level details that a method like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) would typically focus on.\n\nSpecifically, the nodes retrieved by RAPTOR encompass the following:\n\n- **Higher-level summaries** that capture the overarching themes, such as 'courage, resilience, transformation.'\n- More detailed plot information, including critical events such as Cinderella attending the ball and finding the glass slipper. \n\nThis hierarchical summarization allows RAPTOR to aggregate relevant information across different levels in the tree, thus enabling it to effectively answer multi-hop questions by integrating insights from various layers rather than retrieving isolated text fragments like DPR does.\n\nThe core takeaway from the figure is that RAPTOR's ability to retrieve from various layers helps in synthesizing complex inquiries about narrative structure and thematic coherence, enhancing the quality of the response to the specified questions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",

Additionally, RAPTOR includes detailed plot points relevant to the questions, such as **attending the ball** and **finding the glass slipper**. This multi-layered approach allows RAPTOR to synthesize complex inquiries, enhancing the quality of responses compared to traditional methods like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) [rag-1].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis confirms that RAPTOR does retrieve relevant nodes from Figure 4 for the questions posed. This retrieval process illustrates RAPTOR's capability to aggregate and synthesize information effectively, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the narrative structure and thematic coherence of the Cinderella story. The nodes retrieved highlight the importance of both thematic insights and key plot points, showcasing RAPTOR's advanced retrieval capabilities.\n\nIn summary, RAPTOR's selection of nodes from the intermediate and root layers demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing complex queries related to Figure 4, thereby affirming its utility in narrative analysis.",
