      "raw_result": "In **Figure 3**, which is a line chart comparing the performance of two querying methods — \"Collapsed tree\" and \"Tree Traversal\" — on the QASPER dataset:\n\n- The **horizontal axis (x-axis)** is labeled **\"Context Length\"**, measured in tokens, ranging from 0 to 2500. This represents the amount of context used by each querying method.\n  \n- The **vertical axis (y-axis)** is labeled **\"F1 Score\"**, ranging from 40 to 60. This metric quantifies the performance of the querying methods.\n\nThese labels are consistent with the visual representation and accompanying captions that describe Figure 3 as evaluating method performance across varying context lengths using the F1 score as the evaluation metric.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Figure 3\n- [2] Captions\n- [3] Context Length\n- [4] F1 Score\n- [5] Collapsed Tree Retrieval",
      "summary": "In Figure 3, the horizontal axis (x-axis) is labeled 'Context Length' (measured in tokens, ranging from 0 to 2500), and the vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled 'F1 Score' (ranging from 40 to 60). These labels reflect the evaluation of querying methods' performance across varying context lengths.",
