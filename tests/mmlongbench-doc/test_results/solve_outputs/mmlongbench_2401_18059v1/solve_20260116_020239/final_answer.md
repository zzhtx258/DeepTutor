## S1: Axis Labels of Figure 3

Based on the available materials, the horizontal and vertical axes of **Figure 3** are explicitly labeled as follows:

- The **horizontal axis (x-axis)** is labeled **"Context Length"**, measured in tokens, with a range from $0$ to $2500$. This axis represents the varying amounts of context provided to the querying methods being evaluated [rag-1].
  
- The **vertical axis (y-axis)** is labeled **"F1 Score"**, ranging from $40$ to $60$. This metric quantifies the performance of the querying methods — specifically "Collapsed tree" and "Tree Traversal" — on the QASPER dataset [rag-1].

These axis labels reflect the experimental design of Figure 3, which aims to evaluate how querying method performance changes as the context length increases.

### Summary
Figure 3 uses “Context Length” (in tokens) on the x-axis and “F1 Score” (ranging 40–60) on the y-axis to visualize performance trends across different context sizes.

    In Figure 3, the horizontal axis (x-axis) is labeled 'Context Length' (measured in tokens, ranging from 0 to 2500), and the vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled 'F1 Score' (ranging from 40 to 60). These labels reflect the evaluation of querying methods' performance across varying context lengths.
