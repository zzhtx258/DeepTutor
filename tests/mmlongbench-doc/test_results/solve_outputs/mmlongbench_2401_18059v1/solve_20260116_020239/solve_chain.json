This axis represents the varying amounts of context provided to the querying methods being evaluated [rag-1].\n  \n- The **vertical axis (y-axis)** is labeled **\"F1 Score\"**, ranging from $40$ to $60$. This metric quantifies the performance of the querying methods — specifically \"Collapsed tree\" and \"Tree Traversal\" — on the QASPER dataset [rag-1].\n\nThese axis labels reflect the experimental design of Figure 3, which aims to evaluate how querying method performance changes as the context length increases.\n\n### Summary\nFigure 3 uses “Context Length” (in tokens) on the x-axis and “F1 Score” (ranging 40–60) on the y-axis to visualize performance trends across different context sizes.",
