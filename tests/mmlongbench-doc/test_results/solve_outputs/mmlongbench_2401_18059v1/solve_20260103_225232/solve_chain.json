Specifically, it includes:\n- **Tree Traversal Methods**: This aspect is represented by various top-k values, specifically 5, 10, and 20. These values indicate the number of top results returned by the tree traversal method.\n- **Collapsed Tree Configurations**: For this method, the axis details context lengths ranging from 500 to 2500 tokens. This variation allows for the assessment of how different context lengths impact retrieval performance.\n\n### Vertical Axis (Y-axis)\nThe vertical axis measures the **F1 score**, a crucial metric for evaluating the effectiveness of the retrieval methods. The F1 score values in this figure range from approximately 0.45 to 0.58. This range reflects the performance of the querying methods applied to the QASPER dataset, indicating how accurately the retrieval processes are performing. \n\n### Summary of Findings\nOverall, Figure 3 visually contrasts the effectiveness of the tree traversal and collapsed tree strategies across the specified configurations. Notably, the results suggest that the collapsed tree retrieval method tends to outperform the tree traversal method, particularly at a context length of 2000 tokens, where it achieves the highest F1 score of about 0.575. This finding implies that simultaneous node retrieval is more effective than sequential methods in the context of data retrieval from the QASPER dataset.",
