      "raw_result": "Figure 3 presents a comparison of querying methods related to the retrieval of data from the QASPER dataset. It uses two distinct retrieval strategies: **tree traversal** and **collapsed tree**. The horizontal axis details different configurations of these methods, indicating varying **top-k values** for the tree traversal (with values of 5, 10, and 20) and different **context lengths** for the collapsed tree (ranging from 500 to 2500 tokens). \n\nOn the vertical axis, the chart measures the **F1 score**, which indicates the effectiveness of the retrieval methods. The F1 score values range from approximately 0.45 to 0.58. Notably, the chart highlights that the **collapsed tree retrieval** method outperforms tree traversal, with the optimal configuration of 2000 tokens achieving the highest F1 score, approximately 0.575. This emphasizes the advantages of centralizing retrieval from multiple nodes simultaneously, rather than sequentially, as seen in traditional tree traversal methods.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2401.18059v1.pdf",
