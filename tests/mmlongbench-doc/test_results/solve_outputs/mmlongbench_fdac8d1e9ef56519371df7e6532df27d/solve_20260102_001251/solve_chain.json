      "step_response": "## S1: Interpretation of the Map’s Purpose and Representation\n\nThe map described in the report is not a geographic or topographic representation, but rather a **schematic diagram** designed to visualize the **organizational structure** and **institutional hierarchy** of India’s space program under the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Space (DOS) [rag-1]. Its primary function is to convey how geographically dispersed centers are administratively and functionally integrated into a unified national infrastructure, rather than to depict their actual physical locations or distances.\n\nAt the center of the diagram is the **ISRO Headquarters**, serving as the central node of command and coordination. Radiating outward from this central point are directional lines connecting to eight key centers: the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), North-Eastern Space Applications Centre (NE-SAC), Antrix Corporation, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), and the Space Applications Centre (SAC) [rag-1]. These connections illustrate reporting relationships, functional dependencies, and operational integration—emphasizing administrative flow over spatial accuracy.\n\nThe diagram’s **monochromatic design** and **non-geographic layout** are deliberate design choices. By omitting scale, cardinal directions, and real-world geography, the map avoids visual clutter and redirects focus toward structural relationships. This abstraction allows stakeholders—whether policymakers, engineers, or international collaborators—to quickly grasp the scope and coordination of ISRO’s decentralized yet tightly integrated network. For instance, the placement of SDSC (the primary launch site) and LPSC (responsible for propulsion systems) in relation to headquarters signals their critical roles in mission execution, even if their actual locations in Sriharikota and Thiruvananthapuram are not spatially accurate on the diagram.\n\nIn essence, the map functions as an **organizational blueprint**, transforming a complex, nationwide network of research, development, and operational facilities into an intuitive visual hierarchy. It communicates that despite geographic dispersion—from Ahmedabad to Sriharikota to the northeastern states—these centers operate as interdependent components of a single, coherent national space enterprise under ISRO’s leadership [rag-1].\n\nThe absence of numerical data, labels for size or budget, or geographic markers further confirms that this is not a tool for logistical planning, but a strategic overview tool for understanding institutional architecture. Such schematic maps are commonly used in large bureaucratic or technical organizations to simplify complexity and reinforce unity of purpose across distributed entities.\n\n### Summary  \nThe map is a purpose-built schematic that prioritizes organizational clarity over geographic precision, visually encoding the hierarchical integration of ISRO’s eight major centers under its headquarters to illustrate the structural unity of India’s space program.",
