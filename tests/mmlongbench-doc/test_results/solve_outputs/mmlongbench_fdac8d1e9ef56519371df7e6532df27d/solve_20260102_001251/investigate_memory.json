      "raw_result": "The report includes a schematic diagram that maps the organizational structure and geographic distribution of key centers within India's space program, administered by the Department of Space (DOS) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). This diagram is presented as a hierarchical and radial layout, with ISRO Headquarters positioned at the center. From this central node, directional lines connect to eight peripheral nodes representing major research and operational centers: Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), North Eastern-Space Applications Centre (NE-SAC), Antrix Corporation Limited, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), and Space Applications Centre (SAC).\n\nThe schematic uses a monochromatic design with black text on a white background, indicating its purpose as an official internal or presentation graphic. The layout visually reinforces functional relationships among the centers, highlighting how geographically dispersed facilities—such as NARL in Gadanki and NE-SAC in Shillong—are integrated into the national space infrastructure. Antrix Corporation Limited, as the commercial arm of ISRO, is shown with equal structural weight, emphasizing its role in technology transfer and marketization. The diagram serves as a high-level organizational map, illustrating the decentralized yet coordinated ecosystem that supports ISRO’s mission in science, technology, and application.\n\nThis map is complemented by other visual elements in the report, such as budget allocation charts and facility photographs, which collectively provide a comprehensive view of ISRO’s institutional framework. The schematic does not include numerical data or geographic coordinates but instead focuses on structural connectivity and institutional hierarchy, aligning with the context provided in pages 16–18 of the source document.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",
      "summary": "The map in the report is a schematic diagram showing the organizational structure and geographic distribution of key centers in India's space program, led by ISRO and the Department of Space. It features ISRO Headquarters at the center, with directional lines connecting to eight major centers including PRL, NARL, NE-SAC, Antrix Corporation, LPSC, IPRC, SDSC, and SAC. The monochromatic layout emphasizes structural relationships and institutional hierarchy rather than geographic accuracy or numerical data, illustrating how dispersed facilities are integrated into a coordinated national space infrastructure.",
