## S1: Primary Uses and Applications of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation

The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellite Constellation, developed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), serves as a cornerstone for national development, environmental stewardship, and disaster resilience. Its applications span multiple critical sectors, enabling evidence-based decision-making and operational support across government agencies and regional authorities.

### Core Application Domains

1. **Agricultural Monitoring**  
   The constellation provides high-resolution and multi-spectral data essential for crop inventory, acreage estimation, and yield forecasting. This supports food security planning, subsidy allocation, and early warning systems for crop failure due to drought or pest infestation [rag-1].

2. **Disaster Management and Emergency Response**  
   Satellites such as RISAT-1 (radar imaging) and INSAT-3DR (meteorological) enable real-time monitoring of natural disasters including forest fires, earthquakes, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods. The system also extends international emergency support during cross-border crises, demonstrating India’s role in global humanitarian response [rag-1].

3. **Water Resource Planning**  
   Through groundwater mapping and surface water body monitoring, the IRS satellites assist in sustainable water management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This includes identifying potential aquifers and tracking seasonal variations in reservoirs and rivers [rag-1].

4. **Sericulture Development**  
   Specialized satellite data aids in monitoring mulberry plantations and assessing environmental conditions conducive to silkworm rearing, thereby supporting livelihoods in sericulture-dependent communities [rag-1].

5. **Satellite-Aided Search and Rescue (SAR)**  
   Leveraging payloads on satellites like SCATSAT and INSAT-3DR, the constellation contributes to the COSPAS-SARSAT international distress alert system, enabling rapid location and rescue of individuals in maritime, aviation, or remote land emergencies [rag-1].

### Operational Coordination

These diverse functions are coordinated through ISRO’s **National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)** and its network of **Regional Remote Sensing Centres (RRSCs)**, ensuring localized data delivery and application-specific analytics. Key satellites deployed include:
- **RISAT-1**: All-weather radar imaging for agriculture and disaster monitoring.
- **RESOURCESAT-2A**: Multi-spectral optical imaging for resource mapping.
- **SCATSAT**: Wind vector measurement over oceans for cyclone tracking.
- **INSAT-3DR**: Meteorological observations and SAR payload for emergency alerts [rag-1].

The IRS constellation thus embodies a strategic national asset, integrating space technology with societal needs to enhance resilience, productivity, and governance across India’s vast and diverse geographies.
