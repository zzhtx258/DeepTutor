A detailed analysis reveals that the mission with the least number of satellites launched during this period occurred in the fiscal year 2013-14, which included only a single satellite, the INSAT-3D.\n\n### Breakdown of Missions and Satellite Launches\n\n1. **2012-13**: Multiple satellites launched, including various communication and earth observation satellites.\n2. **2013-14**: The INSAT-3D satellite was launched, marking this year as the one with the least number of satellites.\n3. **2014-15**: Featured a more extensive launch schedule with several satellites, including the IRNSS series.\n4. **2015-16**: Included multiple launches, notably the ASTROSAT and several IRNSS satellites.\n5. **2016-17**: This year saw the launch of multiple GSAT satellites, further increasing the total count.\n\nIn summary, the fiscal year 2013-14 stands out as the year with the least satellite launches, with only the INSAT-3D satellite being deployed. This information underscores the variability in ISRO's launch activities during this period, reflecting strategic priorities and mission objectives.",

The missions in question are:\n\n1. **PSLV-C11 (2012)**: Launched 2 satellites.\n2. **PSLV-C23 (2014)**: Launched 5 satellites.\n3. **PSLV-C29 (2016)**: Launched 7 satellites.\n4. **PSLV-C37 (2017)**: Launched a record 104 satellites.\n\nFrom this breakdown, it is evident that the mission with the least number of satellites launched is **PSLV-C11**, which deployed only **2 satellites**. This analysis highlights the variability in the scale of missions undertaken by ISRO, with PSLV-C37 representing a significant contrast with its record launch of 104 satellites.\n\nIn summary, the PSLV-C11 mission stands out as the one with the least number of satellite launches during the specified period, confirming the diverse objectives and capabilities of the Indian Space Program.",
