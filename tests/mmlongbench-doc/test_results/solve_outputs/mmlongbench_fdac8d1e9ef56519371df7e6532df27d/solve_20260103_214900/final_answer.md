## S1: Analysis of Indian Space Program Missions (2012-2017)

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) undertook several missions from 2012 to 2017, characterized by varying numbers of satellites launched each year. A detailed analysis reveals that the mission with the least number of satellites launched during this period occurred in the fiscal year 2013-14, which included only a single satellite, the INSAT-3D.

### Breakdown of Missions and Satellite Launches

1. **2012-13**: Multiple satellites launched, including various communication and earth observation satellites.
2. **2013-14**: The INSAT-3D satellite was launched, marking this year as the one with the least number of satellites.
3. **2014-15**: Featured a more extensive launch schedule with several satellites, including the IRNSS series.
4. **2015-16**: Included multiple launches, notably the ASTROSAT and several IRNSS satellites.
5. **2016-17**: This year saw the launch of multiple GSAT satellites, further increasing the total count.

In summary, the fiscal year 2013-14 stands out as the year with the least satellite launches, with only the INSAT-3D satellite being deployed. This information underscores the variability in ISRO's launch activities during this period, reflecting strategic priorities and mission objectives.

## S2: Analysis of Missions with Least Satellite Launches

To determine which mission of the Indian Space Program from 2012 to 2017 included the least number of satellites launched, we can analyze the data from the significant missions during this period. The missions in question are:

1. **PSLV-C11 (2012)**: Launched 2 satellites.
2. **PSLV-C23 (2014)**: Launched 5 satellites.
3. **PSLV-C29 (2016)**: Launched 7 satellites.
4. **PSLV-C37 (2017)**: Launched a record 104 satellites.

From this breakdown, it is evident that the mission with the least number of satellites launched is **PSLV-C11**, which deployed only **2 satellites**. This analysis highlights the variability in the scale of missions undertaken by ISRO, with PSLV-C37 representing a significant contrast with its record launch of 104 satellites.

In summary, the PSLV-C11 mission stands out as the one with the least number of satellite launches during the specified period, confirming the diverse objectives and capabilities of the Indian Space Program.
