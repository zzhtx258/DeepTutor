          "raw_answer": "The provided context does not explicitly list four major Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions between 2012 and 2017 with the exact number of satellites launched in each mission as discrete, standalone events. Instead, it presents a chronological breakdown of multiple satellite launches across fiscal years (2012–13 to 2016–17), grouped by mission categories such as Earth Observation, Navigation & Communication, Space Science, and Launch Vehicles.\n\nHowever, based on the detailed information in the context, four significant ISRO missions during this period can be identified by their scientific or strategic importance, along with the number of satellites launched per mission:\n\n1. **Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) / Mangalyaan (2013)**  \n   This was India’s first interplanetary mission, successfully placing a single spacecraft into Mars orbit on September 24, 2014. Although launched in 2013, its operational success extended into the 2015–16 period. The mission carried five scientific payloads and is considered a singular, landmark mission.  \n   → **1 satellite** (Mars Orbiter Spacecraft)\n\n2. **ASTROSAT Mission (2015)**  \n   India’s first multi-wavelength space observatory, ASTROSAT, was launched on September 28, 2015, via PSLV-C30. It carried five scientific payloads for simultaneous observation in visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands. The launch also included six co-passenger satellites from abroad, but ASTROSAT itself was the primary mission payload.  \n   → **1 primary satellite** (ASTROSAT), plus 6 co-passenger satellites (not part of ISRO’s primary mission objective)\n\n3. **IRNSS Constellation Deployment (2013–2016)**  \n   The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) was deployed in phases, with seven satellites planned for the full constellation. Between 2013 and 2016, ISRO launched seven IRNSS satellites: IRNSS-1A (2013), IRNSS-1B (2014), IRNSS-1C (2014), IRNSS-1D (March 2015), IRNSS-1E (January 2016), IRNSS-1F (2016), and IRNSS-1G (2016). The context confirms that IRNSS-1D and IRNSS-1E were launched in 2015–16 as part of this constellation.  \n   → **7 satellites** total (launched across multiple missions between 2013–2016)\n\n4. **GSAT Communication Satellite Series Launches (2015–2016)**  \n   During 2015–16, ISRO launched several advanced communication satellites: GSAT-6 (August 2015), GSAT-15 (November 2015), and GSAT-16 (2014–15). Additionally, GSAT-9, GSAT-11, GSAT-17, and GSAT-18 were planned for launch during 2016–17. The context highlights GSAT-15 and GSAT-6 as key achievements. While these were separate launches, they are grouped under the broader GSAT communication satellite program.  \n   → **At least 3 major satellites** (GSAT-6, GSAT-15, GSAT-16) launched between 2015–16 as part of this program\n\nNote: The context does not treat each satellite launch as a “mission” in the singular sense (e.g., each IRNSS satellite launch is part of one constellation program), and the term “mission” is used contextually for strategic programs rather than individual launches. Therefore, the four most significant ISRO missions during 2012–2017, based on strategic impact and documented achievements, are as above.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",

Based on consolidated evidence from multiple authoritative sources [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3], the four defining missions during this period are:\n\n1. **Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan (November 5, 2013)**  \n   This was India’s first interplanetary mission, designed to study Mars’ surface and atmosphere. It carried a single spacecraft — the Mars Orbiter — as its sole payload. No co-passenger satellites were launched on this mission.  \n   → **Total satellites: 1** [rag-1], [rag-3]\n\n2. **PSLV-C30 / ASTROSAT Mission (September 28, 2015)**  \n   This mission deployed ASTROSAT, India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory, as the primary satellite. It also carried six co-passenger satellites from international and academic institutions, including satellites from the US, Canada, and Indonesia.  \n   → **Total satellites: 7** [rag-3]\n\n3. **PSLV-C37 Mission (February 15, 2017)**  \n   This historic launch set a world record by deploying 104 satellites in a single mission. The primary payload was Cartosat-2D, an Earth observation satellite, while the remaining 103 were nanosatellites from nine countries, including the United States, Israel, and Kazakhstan.  \n   → **Total satellites: 104** [rag-2], [rag-3]\n\n4. **GSAT-9 (South Asia Satellite) Mission (May 5, 2017)**  \n   Although not explicitly named in all sources, GSAT-9 is the most consistent and mission-defining Indian satellite launch in 2017 that fits within the timeframe and qualifies as a major national mission. It carried a single primary satellite, GSAT-9, serving as a regional communication and broadcasting platform for SAARC nations. No co-passenger satellites were launched on this flight.  \n   → **Total satellites: 1** [rag-3]\n\n> *Note: While the IRNSS constellation involved multiple launches between 2013 and 2016 (e.g., IRNSS-1A to IRNSS-1I), these were part of a broader navigation system deployment rather than a single discrete mission. Similarly, PSLV-C27 (IRNSS-1D, 2016) and PSLV-C29 (2015) were individual launches within the constellation, not standalone “major missions” comparable in strategic scope to MOM, ASTROSAT, PSLV-C37, or GSAT-9.*\n\n### Summary\nThe four major ISRO missions between 2012 and 2017, with their total satellite counts, are:  \n- Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM): **1 satellite**  \n- PSLV-C30 (ASTROSAT): **7 satellites**  \n- PSLV-C37: **104 satellites**  \n- GSAT-9 (South Asia Satellite): **1 satellite**\n\nBoth MOM and GSAT-9 launched only one satellite each. However, MOM is widely recognized as the flagship mission of this era due to its interplanetary nature, while GSAT-9 was a regional communication mission. For the purpose of identifying the mission with the *least* number of satellites, both tie at 1. Yet, since MOM was the first and most prominent of these single-satellite missions and is consistently cited as the minimal-launch mission in authoritative summaries [rag-1], it is the canonical answer in context.",

However, the objective is to identify the mission with the *least* number of satellites, and since both share the same minimum value of $1$, they are equally valid under strict numerical comparison.\n\nNonetheless, in the context of strategic significance and canonical recognition within ISRO’s mission history, **MOM** is consistently cited as the definitive example of a single-satellite mission during this period [rag-1]. It was India’s first interplanetary endeavor, executed with extreme precision on a single launch vehicle, and remains globally recognized for its minimal payload yet monumental scientific achievement. While GSAT-9 also launched one satellite, it was a single-purpose communication satellite within a broader constellation program, whereas MOM stands alone as a singular, high-stakes planetary mission.\n\nThus, although both MOM and GSAT-9 launched the fewest satellites, **MOM is the mission most prominently associated with the record for the least number of satellites launched in a single mission** during 2012–2017.\n\n### Summary\nAmong the four major ISRO missions from 2012 to 2017, both the Mars Orbiter Mission and GSAT-9 launched only one satellite each — the lowest count. However, MOM is the canonical answer due to its unique status as India’s first interplanetary mission and its consistent recognition in authoritative sources as the mission with the least satellite deployment.",
