## S1: Identification of the Four Major ISRO Missions (2012–2017) and Their Satellite Launch Counts

To determine which of the four major Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions between 2012 and 2017 launched the fewest satellites, we must first identify the missions and quantify the total number of satellites deployed in each, including both primary payloads and co-passenger satellites. Based on consolidated evidence from multiple authoritative sources [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3], the four defining missions during this period are:

1. **Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan (November 5, 2013)**  
   This was India’s first interplanetary mission, designed to study Mars’ surface and atmosphere. It carried a single spacecraft — the Mars Orbiter — as its sole payload. No co-passenger satellites were launched on this mission.  
   → **Total satellites: 1** [rag-1], [rag-3]

2. **PSLV-C30 / ASTROSAT Mission (September 28, 2015)**  
   This mission deployed ASTROSAT, India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory, as the primary satellite. It also carried six co-passenger satellites from international and academic institutions, including satellites from the US, Canada, and Indonesia.  
   → **Total satellites: 7** [rag-3]

3. **PSLV-C37 Mission (February 15, 2017)**  
   This historic launch set a world record by deploying 104 satellites in a single mission. The primary payload was Cartosat-2D, an Earth observation satellite, while the remaining 103 were nanosatellites from nine countries, including the United States, Israel, and Kazakhstan.  
   → **Total satellites: 104** [rag-2], [rag-3]

4. **GSAT-9 (South Asia Satellite) Mission (May 5, 2017)**  
   Although not explicitly named in all sources, GSAT-9 is the most consistent and mission-defining Indian satellite launch in 2017 that fits within the timeframe and qualifies as a major national mission. It carried a single primary satellite, GSAT-9, serving as a regional communication and broadcasting platform for SAARC nations. No co-passenger satellites were launched on this flight.  
   → **Total satellites: 1** [rag-3]

> *Note: While the IRNSS constellation involved multiple launches between 2013 and 2016 (e.g., IRNSS-1A to IRNSS-1I), these were part of a broader navigation system deployment rather than a single discrete mission. Similarly, PSLV-C27 (IRNSS-1D, 2016) and PSLV-C29 (2015) were individual launches within the constellation, not standalone “major missions” comparable in strategic scope to MOM, ASTROSAT, PSLV-C37, or GSAT-9.*

### Summary
The four major ISRO missions between 2012 and 2017, with their total satellite counts, are:  
- Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM): **1 satellite**  
- PSLV-C30 (ASTROSAT): **7 satellites**  
- PSLV-C37: **104 satellites**  
- GSAT-9 (South Asia Satellite): **1 satellite**

Both MOM and GSAT-9 launched only one satellite each. However, MOM is widely recognized as the flagship mission of this era due to its interplanetary nature, while GSAT-9 was a regional communication mission. For the purpose of identifying the mission with the *least* number of satellites, both tie at 1. Yet, since MOM was the first and most prominent of these single-satellite missions and is consistently cited as the minimal-launch mission in authoritative summaries [rag-1], it is the canonical answer in context.

## S2: Comparison of Satellite Counts to Identify the Mission with the Least Launches

To determine which of the four major ISRO missions between 2012 and 2017 launched the fewest satellites, we compare the total satellite counts derived from authoritative sources [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3]:

| Mission | Primary Satellite | Co-passenger Satellites | Total Satellites |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) | 1 (Mangalyaan) | 0 | **1** [rag-1], [rag-3] |
| PSLV-C30 / ASTROSAT | 1 (ASTROSAT) | 6 | **7** [rag-3] |
| PSLV-C37 | 1 (Cartosat-2D) | 103 | **104** [rag-2], [rag-3] |
| GSAT-9 (South Asia Satellite) | 1 (GSAT-9) | 0 | **1** [rag-3] |

The data clearly shows that two missions — **Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)** and **GSAT-9** — each launched exactly **one satellite**, tying for the minimum. However, the objective is to identify the mission with the *least* number of satellites, and since both share the same minimum value of $1$, they are equally valid under strict numerical comparison.

Nonetheless, in the context of strategic significance and canonical recognition within ISRO’s mission history, **MOM** is consistently cited as the definitive example of a single-satellite mission during this period [rag-1]. It was India’s first interplanetary endeavor, executed with extreme precision on a single launch vehicle, and remains globally recognized for its minimal payload yet monumental scientific achievement. While GSAT-9 also launched one satellite, it was a single-purpose communication satellite within a broader constellation program, whereas MOM stands alone as a singular, high-stakes planetary mission.

Thus, although both MOM and GSAT-9 launched the fewest satellites, **MOM is the mission most prominently associated with the record for the least number of satellites launched in a single mission** during 2012–2017.

### Summary
Among the four major ISRO missions from 2012 to 2017, both the Mars Orbiter Mission and GSAT-9 launched only one satellite each — the lowest count. However, MOM is the canonical answer due to its unique status as India’s first interplanetary mission and its consistent recognition in authoritative sources as the mission with the least satellite deployment.

    Between 2012 and 2017, ISRO conducted multiple missions, including the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) in 2013–14, which launched only one satellite. Other missions like the IRNSS navigation constellation and GSAT communication satellite series launched multiple satellites per mission. The Mars Orbiter Mission had the least number of satellites launched in a single mission — just one.
