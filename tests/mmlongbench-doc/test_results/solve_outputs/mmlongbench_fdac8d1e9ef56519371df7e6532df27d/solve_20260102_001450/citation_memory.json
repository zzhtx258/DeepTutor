      "raw_result": "Between 2012–13 and 2016–17, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched a significant number of satellites across multiple mission categories, reflecting a strategic shift toward operational deployment and technological self-reliance. The breakdown by fiscal year and mission type is as follows:\n\nIn **2012–13**, ISRO launched RISAT-1 and SARAL under Earth Observation Satellites, and GSAT-10 under Procured Launch Service / Space Science & Planetary. This year marked the beginning of a series of key missions, including the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), which was launched in November 2013 but is often associated with the 2013–14 fiscal cycle due to its orbital insertion timing.\n\nIn **2013–14**, ISRO launched INSAT-3D under Navigation & Communication Satellites, and GSAT-7 and the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) under Procured Launch Service / Space Science & Planetary. MOM, launched via PSLV-C25, became India’s first interplanetary spacecraft and successfully entered Mars orbit in September 2014, making India the first nation to succeed on its maiden Mars mission.\n\nIn **2014–15**, ISRO deployed the IRNSS-1B, IRNSS-1C, and IRNSS-1D satellites as part of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), alongside GSAT-16 under Procured Launch Service / Space Science & Planetary. Additionally, the CARE (Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment) test vehicle was launched as part of technology development for future human spaceflight.\n\nIn **2015–16**, ISRO achieved a major milestone with the launch of **IRNSS-1D** (March 2015) and **IRNSS-1E** (January 2016), bringing the IRNSS constellation to five of seven planned satellites. This period also saw the successful launch of **ASTROSAT**, India’s first multi-wavelength space observatory, aboard PSLV-C30. Other key launches included **GSAT-15**, India’s advanced communication satellite carrying GAGAN payload, launched via Ariane-5; and **GSAT-6**, an S-band communication satellite launched by GSLV-D6. This year also featured multiple PSLV missions carrying foreign satellites, including 17 international payloads across five commercial launches.\n\nIn **2016–17**, ISRO completed the IRNSS constellation with the launches of GSAT-9, GSAT-11, GSAT-18, and GSAT-19, alongside the RLV-TD MK II-D1 reusable launch vehicle test and multiple PSLV flights (C36, C37, C38). This year also marked the continued expansion of India’s communication satellite fleet and the maturation of its launch vehicle capabilities.\n\nAcross the five-year period (2012–13 to 2016–17), ISRO launched **at least 30 distinct satellites** under its core programs, including Earth Observation, Navigation, Communication, Space Science, and Technology Development. This does not include the numerous co-passenger or foreign satellites launched on PSLV missions, which added over 50 additional payloads during this time, primarily through commercial launches managed by Antrix Corporation.\n\nThe cumulative growth in launch frequency and mission complexity underscores ISRO’s transition from technology demonstration to operational excellence, with a clear focus on regional navigation autonomy (IRNSS), communication infrastructure (GSAT series), space science (ASTROSAT, MOM), and reusable launch vehicle development.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The provided context does not explicitly list four major Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions between 2012 and 2017 with the exact number of satellites launched in each mission as discrete, standalone events. Instead, it presents a chronological breakdown of multiple satellite launches across fiscal years (2012–13 to 2016–17), grouped by mission categories such as Earth Observation, Navigation & Communication, Space Science, and Launch Vehicles.\n\nHowever, based on the detailed information in the context, four significant ISRO missions during this period can be identified by their scientific or strategic importance, along with the number of satellites launched per mission:\n\n1. **Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) / Mangalyaan (2013)**  \n   This was India’s first interplanetary mission, successfully placing a single spacecraft into Mars orbit on September 24, 2014. Although launched in 2013, its operational success extended into the 2015–16 period. The mission carried five scientific payloads and is considered a singular, landmark mission.  \n   → **1 satellite** (Mars Orbiter Spacecraft)\n\n2. **ASTROSAT Mission (2015)**  \n   India’s first multi-wavelength space observatory, ASTROSAT, was launched on September 28, 2015, via PSLV-C30. It carried five scientific payloads for simultaneous observation in visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands. The launch also included six co-passenger satellites from abroad, but ASTROSAT itself was the primary mission payload.  \n   → **1 primary satellite** (ASTROSAT), plus 6 co-passenger satellites (not part of ISRO’s primary mission objective)\n\n3. **IRNSS Constellation Deployment (2013–2016)**  \n   The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) was deployed in phases, with seven satellites planned for the full constellation. Between 2013 and 2016, ISRO launched seven IRNSS satellites: IRNSS-1A (2013), IRNSS-1B (2014), IRNSS-1C (2014), IRNSS-1D (March 2015), IRNSS-1E (January 2016), IRNSS-1F (2016), and IRNSS-1G (2016). The context confirms that IRNSS-1D and IRNSS-1E were launched in 2015–16 as part of this constellation.  \n   → **7 satellites** total (launched across multiple missions between 2013–2016)\n\n4. **GSAT Communication Satellite Series Launches (2015–2016)**  \n   During 2015–16, ISRO launched several advanced communication satellites: GSAT-6 (August 2015), GSAT-15 (November 2015), and GSAT-16 (2014–15). Additionally, GSAT-9, GSAT-11, GSAT-17, and GSAT-18 were planned for launch during 2016–17. The context highlights GSAT-15 and GSAT-6 as key achievements. While these were separate launches, they are grouped under the broader GSAT communication satellite program.  \n   → **At least 3 major satellites** (GSAT-6, GSAT-15, GSAT-16) launched between 2015–16 as part of this program\n\nNote: The context does not treat each satellite launch as a “mission” in the singular sense (e.g., each IRNSS satellite launch is part of one constellation program), and the term “mission” is used contextually for strategic programs rather than individual launches. Therefore, the four most significant ISRO missions during 2012–2017, based on strategic impact and documented achievements, are as above.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",

      "raw_result": "Between 2012 and 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) executed several landmark missions, each involving the launch of one or more satellites, including primary payloads and co-passenger satellites. Based on the provided context, the four major missions with exact satellite counts are as follows:\n\n1. **PSLV-C30 (September 28, 2015)**  \n   This mission launched **ASTROSAT**, India’s first multi-wavelength space observatory, as the primary satellite, along with **six co-passenger satellites** from international customers. The total number of satellites launched in this mission was **7**. The satellites were placed into a 650 km orbit with a 6-degree inclination.\n\n2. **PSLV-C37 (February 15, 2017)**  \n   This mission set a world record by launching **104 satellites** in a single flight. The primary satellite was **Cartosat-2 series**, and the remaining 103 were co-passenger satellites from international customers, including the United States, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. This mission demonstrated ISRO’s capability in commercial launch services and precise multi-satellite deployment.\n\n3. **PSLV-C29 (December 16, 2015)**  \n   This mission carried **six international customer satellites**, including Singapore’s TeLEOS-1 (400 kg), as co-passenger payloads. There was no Indian primary satellite listed for this flight, making it a dedicated commercial mission. The total number of satellites launched was **6**.\n\n4. **PSLV-C27 (March 28, 2015)**  \n   This mission launched **IRNSS-1D**, the fourth satellite of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), as the primary payload. No co-passenger satellites were carried on this flight. The total number of satellites launched was **1**.\n\nThese missions highlight ISRO’s dual focus on strategic national programs (like IRNSS and ASTROSAT) and commercial launch services, with PSLV-C37 standing out as the most complex multi-satellite deployment during the period.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",
