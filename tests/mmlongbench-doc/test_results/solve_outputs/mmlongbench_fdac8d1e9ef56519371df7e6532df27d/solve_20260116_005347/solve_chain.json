These are not generic images but specifically identified facilities associated with Indian space and technology institutions, primarily under ISRO and its affiliated units.\n\nThe seven exterior photos are:\n\n1. **Semi-cryogenic Cold Flow Test Facility at IPRC Mahendragiri** — An infrastructure for testing semi-cryogenic engine subsystems.\n2. **IIRS Main Building in Dehradun** — The main administrative and operational building of the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing.\n3. **LPSC Bengaluru Campus with rocket models and fountain** — A campus view showcasing rocket models and landscaping elements.\n4. **Mt. Abu Infrared Observatory Facility** — An observatory facility located in Rajasthan.\n5. **ISRO Satellite Integration and Test Establishment (ISITE) Building** — A key facility for satellite assembly and testing.\n6. **ITC Building at ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU)** — Part of the unit responsible for inertial navigation systems.\n7. **Semi-Conductor Laboratory Cleanroom Operations** — Noted as a composite image implying an exterior or campus context, likely representing the cleanroom facility’s external environment or surrounding infrastructure.\n\nThese images collectively serve to visually document major organisational infrastructures involved in India’s space and technological development programs.\n\n### Summary\nThe report provides exactly **seven** exterior photos of organisations, each tied to a specific facility or campus, as documented in the summary. No additional images or ambiguous references were found that would alter this count.",
