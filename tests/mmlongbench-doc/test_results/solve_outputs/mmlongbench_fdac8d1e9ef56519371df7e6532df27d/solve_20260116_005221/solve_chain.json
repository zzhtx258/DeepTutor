These organizations are:\n\n1. **ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)** — Described as the central agency for India’s space activities, including satellite development, launch vehicle design, and planetary exploration missions.\n2. **Department of Space (DOS)** — Outlined as the governmental body overseeing ISRO and other space-related institutions, responsible for policy formulation and budget allocation.\n3. **Physical Research Laboratory (PRL)** — Highlighted for its contributions to space science research, particularly in planetary sciences and atmospheric studies.\n4. **National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL)** — Focused on upper atmospheric and ionospheric research using radar and lidar systems.\n5. **Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL)** — Noted for its role in developing indigenous semiconductor technologies critical for space electronics.\n6. **Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)** — Emphasized for training and research in remote sensing applications for natural resource management and disaster monitoring.\n7. **Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC)** — Described as the key center for developing liquid-fueled rocket engines used in ISRO’s launch vehicles.\n8. **National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)** — Identified as the primary agency for acquiring, processing, and disseminating satellite data for national applications.\n\nEach of these entities is presented with contextual depth, including their organizational hierarchy, scientific or technological focus, and collaborative roles within the broader Indian space ecosystem [rag-1].\n\nThis count is explicitly confirmed by the summary output from the tool execution, which returned the value “8” as the total number of such organizations [none].\n\n### Summary\nThe report provides detailed, paragraph-length introductions for exactly 8 distinct organizations involved in India’s space program, covering their functions, missions, and institutional contexts. This count is directly supported by both the textual summary and the numerical result from the tool execution.",
