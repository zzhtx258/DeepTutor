      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, the following organizations are introduced in detail, with descriptions that extend beyond a single sentence and provide substantive information about their roles, functions, or structure:\n\n### 1. **ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)**\nISRO is presented as India’s primary national space agency, responsible for the entire spectrum of the country’s space program — from conception and development to execution. It oversees landmark missions like the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) and ASTROSAT, manages satellite and launch vehicle design and operation, and coordinates a nationwide network of specialized centers such as VSSC, ISAC, LPSC, SAC, IIRS, and NRSC. ISRO also collaborates with external institutions like PRL and SCL, and operates under the Department of Space as its core operational body. Its mandate includes scientific research, indigenous technology development, and international cooperation.\n\n### 2. **Department of Space (DOS)**\nThe Department of Space is described as the central governing body overseeing India’s space program, implementing national policies, and directly managing ISRO. It also governs autonomous institutions such as PRL, NARL, NE-SAC, and SCL. DOS facilitates technology transfer to Indian industries, ensures RTI compliance, supports human resource development, and provides welfare services like housing, medical care, and schooling for personnel. It works through advisory committees and coordinates programs like INSAT and NNRMS, while being accountable to the Prime Minister and Space Commission.\n\n### 3. **Physical Research Laboratory (PRL)**\nPRL is detailed as an autonomous research institute under DOS, located in Ahmedabad, engaged in fundamental research across Astronomy, Astrophysics, Solar Physics, and Planetary Science. It operates the Mt. Abu Infrared Observatory and contributes to ISRO’s planetary exploration missions. The lab is visually represented in maps and images, emphasizing its role in space-related science and its institutional infrastructure.\n\n### 4. **National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL)**\nNARL is described as a DOS-affiliated laboratory focused on atmospheric and space sciences, particularly at its facility in Gadanki near Tirupati. It operates the MST Radar Facility and comprises seven major research groups, including the Atmospheric Structure and Dynamics Group and the Computers and Data Management Group. NARL is depicted in organizational charts and budget visualizations, highlighting its integration into India’s broader space infrastructure.\n\n### 5. **Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL)**\nSCL is introduced as an autonomous entity under DOS, located in Chandigarh, specializing in designing, developing, and fabricating CMOS/MEMS devices, including the Vikram Processor. It supports ISRO by providing high-reliability electronic components and is involved in indigenizing electronics for defense applications like the Indian Air Force. Its cleanroom operations are visually documented, showcasing advanced semiconductor fabrication under yellow photolithography lighting.\n\n### 6. **Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)**\nIIRS is portrayed as a premier institute in Dehradun dedicated to capacity building in Remote Sensing and Geo-informatics through postgraduate education and training. It offers awareness programs to introduce participants to geo-spatial technologies and is shown on maps and in images of its main building. IIRS is positioned as a sub-unit under SAC in organizational charts, reflecting its role in applied space science education.\n\n### 7. **Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC)**\nLPSC is detailed as a major ISRO center responsible for propulsion system development, with campuses in Valiamala and Bengaluru. It develops control components, delivers propulsion systems, and has sub-units like IPRC and IISU. The Bengaluru campus features modernist architecture and houses facilities for system design/engineering. LPSC’s role in supporting launch vehicles and satellites is emphasized, along with its collaborative relationship with ISRO.\n\n### 8. **National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)**\nNRSC is described as a key ISRO center based in Hyderabad, responsible for satellite data acquisition, processing, dissemination, aerial remote sensing, and disaster management support. It executes application projects in collaboration with user agencies across domains like agriculture and urban planning. NRSC is visually placed in organizational charts and linked to the broader mission of applying space technology for societal benefit.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Document Title One\n- [2] Document Title Two\n- [3] Document Title Three\n- [4] Document Title Four\n- [5] Document Title Five",
