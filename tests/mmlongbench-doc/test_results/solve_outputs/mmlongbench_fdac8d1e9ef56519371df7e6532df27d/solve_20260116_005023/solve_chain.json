      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of Four Indian Space Program Missions (2012–2017) and Satellite Counts\n\nTo address the user’s question, we first identify the four representative missions of the Indian Space Program between 2012 and 2017, along with the number of satellites launched in each. Based on available materials, these four missions are:\n\n1. **Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan)** — Launched during fiscal year 2013–14, this mission deployed **1 satellite** into Mars orbit. It was India’s first interplanetary mission and a landmark achievement for ISRO [rag-1].\n\n2. **IRNSS-1D Launch** — Conducted in fiscal year 2014–15, this mission placed **1 satellite** into geosynchronous orbit as part of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) constellation [rag-1].\n\n3. **ASTROSAT** — Launched in fiscal year 2015–16, this multi-wavelength space observatory carried **1 primary satellite** and **6 co-passenger satellites**, totaling **7 satellites** [rag-1].\n\n4. **GSAT-6** — Also launched in fiscal year 2015–16, this communication satellite mission deployed **1 satellite** into geostationary orbit [rag-1].\n\n### Comparative Summary Table\n\n| Mission             | Fiscal Year | Number of Satellites Launched |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| Mangalyaan          | 2013–14     | 1                             |\n| IRNSS-1D            | 2014–15     | 1                             |\n| ASTROSAT            | 2015–16     | 7                             |\n| GSAT-6              | 2015–16     | 1                             |\n\nFrom this data, it is evident that **Mangalyaan**, **IRNSS-1D**, and **GSAT-6** each launched only **1 satellite**, making them tied for the least number of satellites launched among the four missions. However, since the query asks for “which mission” (singular), and multiple missions tie for the minimum, we note that **Mangalyaan and IRNSS-1D** are explicitly highlighted in the source as having launched the fewest satellites — likely due to their strategic or symbolic significance [rag-1].\n\nThus, based on the provided materials, **Mangalyaan (2013–14)** and **IRNSS-1D (2014–15)** are the missions that include the launch of the least number of satellites — just **1 satellite each**.\n\nThis step establishes the baseline data needed to answer the original question. In the next step, we will determine which of these missions qualifies as the definitive answer if a single mission must be selected, or clarify the tie if multiple are acceptable.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Comparative Analysis of Satellite Launch Counts Across Four Missions\n\nTo determine which mission launched the least number of satellites, we analyze the satellite counts for each of the four identified missions from 2012 to 2017:\n\n- **Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan)** — Launched in fiscal year 2013–14, deployed **1 satellite** into Mars orbit [rag-1].\n- **IRNSS-1D** — Launched in fiscal year 2014–15, placed **1 satellite** into geosynchronous orbit as part of the IRNSS constellation [rag-1].\n- **ASTROSAT** — Launched in fiscal year 2015–16, carried **1 primary satellite** and **6 co-passenger satellites**, totaling **7 satellites** [rag-1].\n- **GSAT-6** — Also launched in fiscal year 2015–16, deployed **1 satellite** into geostationary orbit [rag-1].\n\n### Logical Comparison\n\nWe can express the satellite counts as a set of values:\n$$\n\\{ \\text{Mangalyaan}: 1,\\ \\text{IRNSS-1D}: 1,\\ \\text{ASTROSAT}: 7,\\ \\text{GSAT-6}: 1 \\}\n$$\n\nThe minimum value in this set is $1$, achieved by three missions: Mangalyaan, IRNSS-1D, and GSAT-6. Therefore, these three missions are tied for launching the least number of satellites.\n\nHowever, the source material specifically highlights **Mangalyaan and IRNSS-1D** as having launched “the least number among the listed missions” [rag-1], suggesting that while GSAT-6 also launched only one satellite, it may not be emphasized in the same context — possibly due to mission type (communication vs. interplanetary or navigation) or strategic significance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile technically **three missions (Mangalyaan, IRNSS-1D, and GSAT-6)** launched the least number of satellites (1 each), the materials explicitly identify **Mangalyaan and IRNSS-1D** as the missions with the fewest launches. If forced to select a single mission, **Mangalyaan** is often cited as the most iconic and historically significant of the three, making it the most representative answer under typical interpretive frameworks.\n\nThus, based on both quantitative data and contextual emphasis in the source, **Mangalyaan (2013–14)** is the mission that includes the launch of the least number of satellites — **1 satellite** — and is the most appropriate singular answer to the user’s question.\n\nThis step confirms the tie in satellite count but resolves ambiguity by aligning with source emphasis and mission prominence. In the next step, we will finalize the answer by selecting the most contextually appropriate mission if a single answer is required.",
