      "query": "What are the four Indian Space Program missions from 2012 to 2017, and how many satellites were launched in each mission?",
      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit list of “four Indian Space Program missions from 2012 to 2017” with a fixed count of satellites per mission. Instead, ISRO conducted numerous satellite launches across multiple fiscal years (2012–13 to 2016–17) under broader categories such as Earth Observation, Navigation & Communication, and Space Science & Planetary Exploration.\n\nHowever, we can identify four landmark or representative missions during this period, along with the number of satellites launched in each:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) – Fiscal Year 2013–14**\n- **Satellites Launched**: 1\n- **Details**: India’s first interplanetary mission, successfully placing the Mars Orbiter Spacecraft into orbit around Mars on September 24, 2014. It carried five scientific payloads and demonstrated ISRO’s capability in deep space navigation.\n- **Launch Vehicle**: PSLV-C25\n\n---\n\n### 2. **ASTROSAT Launch – Fiscal Year 2015–16**\n- **Satellites Launched**: 7 (1 primary + 6 co-passenger satellites)\n- **Details**: ASTROSAT was India’s first multi-wavelength astronomy satellite, launched via PSLV-C30. It was accompanied by six international co-passenger satellites, showcasing ISRO’s ability to handle complex multi-satellite deployments.\n- **Launch Vehicle**: PSLV-C30\n\n---\n\n### 3. **IRNSS-1D Launch – Fiscal Year 2014–15**\n- **Satellites Launched**: 1\n- **Details**: The fourth satellite of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), launched by PSLV-C27 into a sub-GTO. It carried navigation and ranging payloads and was later controlled by MCF for in-orbit operations.\n- **Launch Vehicle**: PSLV-C27\n\n---\n\n### 4. **GSAT-6 Launch – Fiscal Year 2015–16**\n- **Satellites Launched**: 1\n- **Details**: A 2117 kg communication satellite launched by GSLV-D6 into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. This mission marked the first successful flight of GSLV-MkII with an indigenous cryogenic stage.\n- **Launch Vehicle**: GSLV-D6\n\n---\n\nThese four missions represent significant technological milestones across planetary exploration, space science, regional navigation, and communication infrastructure during the 2012–2017 period.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Document Title One\n- [2] Document Title Two\n- [3] Document Title Three\n- [4] Document Title Four",

      "content": "Among the four representative Indian Space Program missions from 2012 to 2017, the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) in 2013–14 and the IRNSS-1D launch in 2014–15 each launched only 1 satellite — the least number among the listed missions. ASTROSAT (2015–16) launched 7 satellites (1 primary + 6 co-passengers), and GSAT-6 (2015–16) launched 1 satellite. Thus, Mangalyaan and IRNSS-1D tie for launching the fewest satellites.",
