This institution is an autonomous society under the Department of Space (DOS), India, and is situated in Gadanki, near Tirupati. As a premier center for atmospheric research, NARL focuses on advancing the understanding and prediction of Earth’s atmospheric behavior through observational studies and numerical modeling [rag-1]. Its research activities span multiple domains, including radar development, ionospheric and space research, atmospheric dynamics, and weather and climate studies [rag-1].\n\nThe consistency of this definition across both the summarized and raw excerpts from [rag-1] confirms its reliability, with no conflicting interpretations present in the available materials.\n\nIn summary, NARL stands for National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, a key Indian research institution dedicated to atmospheric sciences under the DOS.",
