      "raw_result": "The report provides a detailed overview of the key organizations that constitute India’s space program under the administrative control of the Department of Space (DOS) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). These organizations span research, development, operations, commercialization, and human resource development, forming a comprehensive ecosystem for India’s space activities.\n\nAt the core of the program is **ISRO Headquarters**, located at Antariksh Bhavan in Bengaluru, which coordinates all major programs including satellite communication, earth observation, launch vehicles, space science, and international cooperation. Supporting this central coordination are several specialized centers. **Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC)** in Thiruvananthapuram serves as the lead center for launch vehicle design and development, with expertise in aeronautics, avionics, and propulsion systems. **Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC SHAR)** in Sriharikota functions as the primary launch site for ISRO’s rockets, including PSLV and GSLV missions.\n\nOther major technical centers include the **Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC)**, with facilities in Bengaluru and Mahendragiri, responsible for developing satellite and launch vehicle propulsion systems, including cryogenic and semi-cryogenic engines. The **Space Applications Centre (SAC)** in Ahmedabad focuses on developing satellite-based applications for communication, remote sensing, and meteorology. The **ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC)** in Bengaluru handles satellite design, integration, and testing, with the **ISITE (ISRO Satellite Integration and Test Establishment)** building housing critical infrastructure such as thermo-vacuum chambers and vibration test facilities.\n\nResearch and specialized institutes play vital roles as well. The **Physical Research Laboratory (PRL)** in Ahmedabad conducts fundamental research in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, and astrochemistry, and contributes to planetary missions like Chandrayaan-2 and Aditya by developing payloads. The **National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL)** in Gadanki specializes in atmospheric studies using advanced facilities like the MST Radar, supporting weather and climate modeling. The **North Eastern-Space Applications Centre (NE-SAC)** in Shillong promotes the use of space technology for regional development in India’s northeastern states, focusing on disaster management, communications, and earth observation.\n\nThe **Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST)** in Thiruvananthapuram, established in 2007 as a deemed university, is dedicated to producing skilled scientists and engineers for ISRO, with 99 graduates from the 2011 batch placed directly into ISRO centers. The **Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)** in Dehradun provides postgraduate education and training in remote sensing and geo-informatics, also hosting the United Nations-affiliated Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTE-AP).\n\nCommercial and industrial support is managed by **Antrix Corporation Limited**, ISRO’s marketing arm, which facilitates the global sale of space products, launch services via PSLV, remote sensing data, and technology transfer. **Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL)** in Chandigarh develops indigenous microelectronics, including VLSI and CMOS devices critical for space systems, such as the Vikram Processor used in launch vehicles. The **ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU)** in Thiruvananthapuram designs and produces inertial sensors, gyroscopes, and actuators for launch vehicles and spacecraft, supported by the Integrated Test Complex (ITC) facility.\n\nAdditional technical units include the **Laboratory for Electro-Optic Systems (LEOS)** in Bengaluru, which develops electro-optic sensors and camera optics for remote sensing and meteorological payloads, and the **National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)** in Hyderabad, responsible for data acquisition, processing, and dissemination from remote sensing satellites. Regional Remote Sensing Centres (RRSCs) extend these capabilities nationwide for applications in agriculture, water resources, forestry, and urban planning.\n\nThese organizations collectively form a vertically integrated and geographically distributed infrastructure that enables India to independently design, develop, launch, and operate advanced space systems while promoting societal applications and global collaboration.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",
