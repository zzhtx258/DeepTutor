      "step_response": "## S1: Determining the Report Year Through Contextual Analysis\n\nThe report does not explicitly state a single \"report year\" as a standalone publication date. However, by analyzing the contextual anchors and key events referenced throughout the material, we can confidently determine that the report pertains to **Fiscal Year 2015–16**.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by multiple corroborating indicators:\n\n- The fiscal year **2015–16** is described as a “landmark period” for ISRO, during which major milestones were achieved, including the launch of **ASTROSAT**, **GSAT-6**, and the completion of the **IRNSS constellation** [rag-1].\n- Additional contextual events such as the **GNSS User Meet 2015** and the launch of the **SAKAAR app** further anchor the timeline to the calendar year 2015, which falls within Fiscal Year 2015–16 [rag-1].\n- A direct summary from tool execution confirms: *“The report is for Fiscal Year 2015–16, anchored by key events in 2015.”*\n\nThus, while no explicit “publication year” is stated, the temporal scope of the content — centered on achievements and events occurring in FY 2015–16 — allows us to conclude that this is the operative year for the report.\n\nIn summary, the report covers activities and accomplishments primarily from **Fiscal Year 2015–16**, with key events rooted in calendar year 2015.",
