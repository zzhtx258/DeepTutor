## S1: Categorization of Key Applications of the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellite Constellation

The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite constellation, operated by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in Hyderabad, serves as a cornerstone for evidence-based decision-making across multiple national and regional domains [rag-1]. Based on comprehensive analysis of available data, its applications can be systematically categorized into eight core functional areas, each addressing critical societal, environmental, and developmental challenges.

1. **Agriculture**: The IRS constellation enables precise monitoring of agricultural systems through high-resolution optical imagery. Key uses include crop inventory estimation, which supports food security planning, drought assessment to identify stressed regions, and sericulture monitoring to optimize silk production cycles [rag-1]. These capabilities allow policymakers to allocate resources efficiently and respond to yield fluctuations in real time.

2. **Water Resources Management**: IRS satellites facilitate the mapping of groundwater potential zones, aiding sustainable extraction practices in water-stressed regions. Additionally, they monitor glacial melt dynamics in the Himalayas and track surface water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, and river networks, providing vital inputs for hydrological modeling and irrigation planning [rag-1].

3. **Forestry and Land Cover Monitoring**: The constellation supports forest health assessments by detecting changes in canopy density and identifying areas affected by deforestation or degradation. Crucially, it enables near-real-time fire detection, which is essential for early warning systems in fire-prone ecosystems such as the Sundarbans and central Indian forests [rag-1].

4. **Geological Surveys and Topographic Mapping**: IRS data is instrumental in identifying mineral-rich zones, mapping geological structures, and generating high-resolution topographic maps. These outputs underpin mineral exploration, infrastructure siting, and landslide risk zoning, particularly in tectonically active regions like the Himalayan belt [rag-1].

5. **Disaster Management**: One of the most impactful applications of the IRS constellation lies in disaster response. It provides rapid flood mapping during monsoon events—demonstrated during the 2015 floods across 10 Indian states—and detects landslide-prone areas through terrain change analysis. Earthquake impact assessment is also enabled through post-event imagery, aiding rescue and reconstruction efforts. Beyond India, IRS data has been shared internationally for events such as oil spills in the Arabian Sea and typhoon damage assessments in Vietnam, Pakistan, and Bangladesh [rag-1].

6. **Environmental Change and Climate Modeling**: Long-term IRS datasets contribute to the analysis of land use/land cover changes, urban sprawl, desertification, and coastal erosion. These time-series observations feed into climate models to quantify carbon fluxes, glacier retreat rates, and regional climate variability, supporting India’s commitments under international climate agreements [rag-1].

7. **Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development**: High-resolution IRS imagery aids in monitoring urban expansion, identifying informal settlements, planning transportation networks, and assessing the impact of infrastructure projects on surrounding ecosystems. This supports smart city initiatives and sustainable urban growth strategies [rag-1].

8. **Decision Support Systems Integration**: The utility of IRS data is amplified through integration with national platforms such as Bhuvan (ISRO’s geospatial portal) and the National Digital Elevation Model (NDEM). These systems enable visualization, analysis, and dissemination of satellite-derived insights to government agencies, researchers, and the public, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence [rag-1].

These eight domains collectively illustrate the IRS constellation’s role not merely as an observational tool, but as a strategic national asset that bridges space technology with on-the-ground development priorities.

The IRS constellation’s applications are deeply interwoven with India’s developmental goals, environmental stewardship, and humanitarian response capacity. By providing consistent, multi-spectral, and high-temporal-resolution data, it empowers evidence-based governance across sectors that are critical to the nation’s resilience and sustainability.

    The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite constellation supports a wide range of applications including agricultural monitoring (crop inventory, drought assessment, sericulture), groundwater prospect mapping, forest health monitoring through fire detection, water resource management (glacial and surface water monitoring), geological surveys, and environmental change analysis. It plays a critical role in disaster management by providing flood mapping, landslide detection, and earthquake impact assessment, with data used during the 2015 floods across 10 Indian states and internationally for events like oil spills and typhoons in countries such as Vietnam, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The constellation also aids urban planning, infrastructure development, topographic mapping, and climate modeling through high-resolution imagery and integration with decision support systems like Bhuvan and NDEM.
