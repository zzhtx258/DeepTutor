## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification and Count of Exterior Photographs

The report explicitly lists and provides eight distinct exterior photographs of organizations involved in India’s space program [rag-1]. These photographs serve as visual documentation of key infrastructure sites that support the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and its affiliated institutions. The identified facilities, each captured in a unique exterior view, are as follows:

- Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)  
- Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC)  
- ISRO Satellite Integration and Test Establishment (ISITE)  
- Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) — documented in two distinct views  
- Integrated Test Complex (ITC)  
- Infrared Observatory at Mt. Abu  
- MST Radar facility at NARL  
- Semi-cryogenic Cold Flow Test facility (SCFT) at IPRC  

Notably, while the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL) is counted as a single organization, it is represented by two separate exterior photographs, contributing to the total count of eight distinct images [rag-1]. This distinction is critical: the count refers to the number of photographic instances, not the number of unique organizations. Thus, even though SCL appears twice, it does not reduce the total number of photographs.

The summary from the available materials confirms this count directly: “The report provides eight distinct exterior photographs of organizations” [rag_naive]. No additional images or ambiguities are indicated in the provided data.

In summary, the report contains exactly eight exterior photographs of organizations, as explicitly stated and itemized in the source material.
