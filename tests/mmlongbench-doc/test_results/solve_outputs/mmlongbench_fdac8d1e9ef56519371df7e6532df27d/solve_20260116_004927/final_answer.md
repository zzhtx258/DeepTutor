## Detailed Answer

## S1: Definition and Context of NARL

NARL stands for the **National Atmospheric Research Laboratory** [rag-1]. It is an autonomous research institution operating under India’s Department of Space (DOS) and is physically located in Gadanki, near Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh [rag-1].

The laboratory is dedicated to advancing scientific understanding of atmospheric and space sciences, with a primary focus on studying the vertical structure and dynamics of the Earth’s atmosphere — specifically the mesosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere [rag-1]. To achieve this, NARL employs advanced observational tools such as the Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) Radar Facility, which enables high-resolution measurements of wind, turbulence, and other atmospheric parameters [rag-1].

In addition to its core research mission, NARL plays a supporting role in India’s broader space program by providing critical atmospheric data that informs satellite operations, launch windows, and space weather forecasting [rag-1]. The organization is structured into seven specialized research groups, each addressing key domains including radar technology development, weather and climate modeling, ionospheric studies, and data management systems [rag-1].

This institutional framework ensures that NARL contributes both fundamental knowledge and applied solutions to national and international atmospheric science challenges.
