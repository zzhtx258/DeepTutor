## S1: Identification of Fiscal Year and Publication Year of the Report

The report explicitly covers the **2015–16 fiscal year**, defined as the period from **January 2015 to December 2015** [rag-1]. This fiscal year designation aligns with the standard practice adopted by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which follows a calendar-year-based fiscal cycle for its annual reporting [rag-1].

The content of the report includes key milestones up to **February 2016**, such as the completion of seventeen months of operation for the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan, launched in 2013) and the successful launch of the IRNSS-1E satellite on **January 20, 2016** [rag-1]. These events, occurring after the end of the fiscal year (December 2015), indicate that the report was compiled and finalized *after* these milestones were achieved. This timing is consistent with standard institutional reporting practices, where annual reports are typically published several months after the close of the fiscal year to ensure all data, outcomes, and late-year activities are accurately incorporated.

Therefore, while the report documents activities within the **2015–16 fiscal year (Jan–Dec 2015)**, its publication date is inferred to be **2016**, most likely in the first quarter (January–March 2016), following the completion of the IRNSS-1E mission and internal review processes.

### Summary  
The report’s covered period is the 2015–16 fiscal year (January–December 2015), and it was published in 2016, as confirmed by the inclusion of post-fiscal-year events and standard reporting delays.
