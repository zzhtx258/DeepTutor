Additionally, it mentions the 2015–16 fiscal year as the reporting period, with specific activities documented from January 2015 to December 2015 under the Right to Information Act. The structure, content, and chronological listing of events strongly indicate that the report was compiled and published after February 2016, likely in 2016, to summarize the achievements of the Indian Space Programme for the 2015–16 period.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] fdac8d1e9ef56519371df7e6532df27d.pdf",
