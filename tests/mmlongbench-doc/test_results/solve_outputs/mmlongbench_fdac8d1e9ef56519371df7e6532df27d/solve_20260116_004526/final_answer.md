## S1: Description and Purpose of the Map in the Report

The map referenced in the report, titled **“Map of Indian Space Programme Facilities”**, is a **thematic map** designed to visually represent the geographical distribution of major space-related research and operational centers across India [rag-1]. Its primary purpose is to provide a spatial overview of India’s national space infrastructure, enabling stakeholders and readers to understand the geographic concentration and dispersion of key institutions involved in the country’s space program.

### Visual Design and Layout
The map employs a distinct color scheme for clarity:
- The territory of India is filled with **magenta**, set against a **light beige background** to enhance contrast and focus.
- Facility locations are marked using **white circular markers**, which serve as visual anchors for each institution.
- Labels positioned around the perimeter of the map identify the **cities** and their associated **institutions**, such as:
  - **Ahmedabad**: Home to the *Physical Research Laboratory*
  - **Dehradun**: Hosts the *Indian Institute of Remote Sensing*

These design choices ensure that the map is both informative and accessible, allowing users to quickly associate geographic locations with specific scientific or operational entities.

### Functional Significance
As a thematic map, it does not merely depict political boundaries but instead emphasizes the spatial organization of a specialized domain — in this case, India’s space infrastructure. This enables strategic analysis, such as identifying regional hubs of activity, assessing logistical accessibility, or planning future facility placements based on existing clusters.

In summary, the map serves as a concise yet comprehensive spatial catalog of India’s space-related institutions, supporting both educational and planning purposes within the context of the national space program [rag-1].
