      "raw_result": "The map in the report, titled **“Map of Indian Space Programme Facilities (image)”**, is a **thematic map** that visually represents the geographical distribution of major space-related research and operational centers across India. It serves as a spatial catalog of institutions under the Indian Space Programme, primarily managed by the Department of Space (DOS) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\n\nKey features of the map include:\n\n- **Geographical Outline**: The country of India is depicted with a solid **magenta-colored fill**, set against a **light beige background** to enhance visual contrast.\n- **Facility Markers**: Each space-related facility — such as laboratories, centers, or institutes — is marked with a **white circular indicator**, precisely positioned to denote its physical location within the country.\n- **Labels**: Around the perimeter of the map, **labels** in bold, uppercase text list the names of cities and their associated facilities, providing clear textual identification for each marked location.\n- **Spatial Context**: The map contextualizes key institutions like the **Physical Research Laboratory (PRL)** in Ahmedabad and the **Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)** in Dehradun, linking them to their geographic positions.\n\nOverall, this thematic map provides a comprehensive, minimalist overview of India’s national space infrastructure, illustrating how critical facilities are distributed geographically to support the nation’s space science, technology, and applications missions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Map of Indian Space Programme Facilities (image)\n- [2] Thematic Map\n- [3] India\n- [4] White Circular Marker\n- [5] Label",
