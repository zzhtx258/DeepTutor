      "raw_result": "To ensure accurate blood pressure and biometric measurements with the Huawei Watch D, the device must be positioned correctly on the wrist. According to the provided context, the center of the watch face should be placed approximately **two finger-widths above the base of the palm**. This positioning is consistently emphasized across multiple visual and textual guides in the user manual.\n\nThe correct placement ensures optimal contact between the watch’s sensors and the radial artery, which is critical for reliable readings of blood pressure, heart rate, SpO₂, and other health metrics. The edge of the watch body should lie just below the ulnar styloid process — the bony prominence on the pinky side of the wrist — without pressing against it or being too far away. This alignment is visually demonstrated in several images referenced in the document, including those showing the watch worn on the dorsal side of the wrist with precise spatial orientation relative to anatomical landmarks.\n\nThese guidelines are reinforced by both instructional text and accompanying images that illustrate proper wear during measurement, ensuring users can replicate the correct positioning for consistent, accurate results.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The Huawei Watch D user guide specifies that the watch should be positioned so that the center of the watch face is approximately two finger-widths above the base of the palm for accurate biometric measurements. While the exact measurement in centimeters is not explicitly stated in the provided context, the instruction consistently references “two finger-widths” as the standard positioning guideline across multiple visual and textual references.\n\nIn general human anatomical terms, two finger-widths (using the width of an average adult’s index and middle fingers placed side by side) equate to approximately 3 to 4 centimeters. This estimation aligns with standard clinical recommendations for blood pressure cuff and wearable sensor placement, where the device is positioned just above the radial artery, avoiding the ulnar styloid process.\n\nThe context reinforces this positioning through repeated visual depictions (e.g., reference_id: 1, images 5b2b39a6..., 6924d32d..., 6568d427...) and textual instructions, confirming that the two-finger rule is a practical, user-friendly proxy for ensuring optimal sensor contact with the radial artery without pressing on anatomical landmarks.\n\nThus, while the manual does not provide a numerical figure in centimeters, the intended distance is universally understood to be about **3–4 cm** based on standard anthropometric interpretation.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
