      "raw_result": "Incorrect postures during blood pressure measurement can significantly affect the accuracy of readings obtained from a smartwatch such as the Huawei Watch D. According to the provided guidelines, the following postures are considered incorrect and should be avoided:\n\n- **Sitting cross-legged**: This posture exerts pressure on the abdomen, which can elevate blood pressure readings.\n- **Sitting on a low sofa or in front of a low table**: These positions may cause the arm to be positioned below heart level, leading to falsely elevated measurements.\n- **Placing the watch below the heart**: The device must be kept at the same height as the heart during measurement. If the wrist is positioned lower than the heart, the reading will be higher than actual.\n- **Arm not supported or bent improperly**: The arm should be bent at approximately 90 degrees with the forearm resting horizontally on a flat surface, palm facing upward, and the watch aligned with the heart. Failure to support the arm properly can introduce variability.\n- **Standing or lying down**: Blood pressure measurements should not be taken while standing or lying down; a seated position with back support is required.\n- **Moving or shifting during measurement**: Any body movement, including speaking, bending fingers, or shifting position, can disrupt signal acquisition and lead to inaccurate results.\n- **Wrist not aligned with heart level**: The center of the watch face must be at the same height as the heart. If the wrist is raised too high or lowered too much, the measurement will be skewed.\n- **Leaning forward or exerting pressure on the abdomen**: This can increase vascular resistance and artificially raise blood pressure values.\n\nThe correct posture involves sitting quietly in a chair with back support, feet flat on the floor, arm bent at 90 degrees, forearm resting on a table, palm facing up, and the watch positioned so its center is about two finger-widths above the base of the palm and below the ulnar styloid process, aligned with heart level.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",

      "content": "The guidebook demonstrates eight incorrect postures for measuring blood pressure: sitting cross-legged, sitting on a low sofa or in front of a low table, placing the watch below heart level, arm not supported or bent improperly, standing or lying down, moving or shifting during measurement, wrist not aligned with heart level, and leaning forward or exerting pressure on the abdomen. These postures can lead to inaccurate readings by affecting vascular resistance, arm position, or signal acquisition.",
