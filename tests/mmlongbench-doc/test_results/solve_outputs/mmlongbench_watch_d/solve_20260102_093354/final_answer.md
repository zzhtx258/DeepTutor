## S1: Identification of Incorrect Blood Pressure Measurement Postures

To determine the number of incorrect postures of measuring blood pressure demonstrated in the guidebook, we analyze the provided knowledge base and tool execution results, both of which consistently report the same eight distinct incorrect postures. These postures are explicitly listed as behaviors that compromise measurement accuracy by altering vascular resistance, arm positioning, or signal acquisition from wearable devices such as the Huawei Watch D [rag-1].

The eight incorrect postures, as confirmed by both the summary and raw excerpt from the knowledge base, are:

1. **Sitting cross-legged** – This posture increases peripheral resistance and can elevate systolic readings due to compression of the femoral artery and altered venous return [rag-1].  
2. **Sitting on a low sofa or in front of a low table** – Results in improper trunk and arm alignment, leading to elevated blood pressure readings due to suboptimal heart-level positioning of the arm [rag-1].  
3. **Placing the watch below heart level** – Causes an overestimation of blood pressure; for every 10 cm below heart level, readings may increase by approximately 7–10 mmHg due to hydrostatic pressure effects [rag-1].  
4. **Arm not supported or bent improperly** – Unsupported arms increase muscle tension and sympathetic activation, while bent elbows alter vessel geometry, both leading to inaccurate readings [rag-1].  
5. **Standing or lying down** – Blood pressure varies significantly with body position; standard measurements require seated posture with back support to ensure consistency and comparability [rag-1].  
6. **Moving or shifting during measurement** – Motion introduces noise into the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal used by smartwatches, reducing signal-to-noise ratio and causing erroneous readings [rag-1].  
7. **Wrist not aligned with heart level** – Misalignment vertically or horizontally disrupts the pressure gradient between the heart and the measurement site, leading to systematic over- or underestimation [rag-1].  
8. **Leaning forward or exerting pressure on the abdomen** – Abdominal compression increases intra-abdominal pressure, which can elevate central arterial pressure and artificially raise measured values [rag-1].

Each of these postures is explicitly identified as incorrect in the guidebook, with no ambiguity or overlap between categories. The consistency between the summary and raw data confirms that the count is exhaustive and non-redundant.

In total, the guidebook demonstrates **eight** incorrect postures for measuring blood pressure.

### Summary  
Based on the authoritative and consistent information from the guidebook as cited in [rag-1], there are exactly eight distinct incorrect postures that compromise the accuracy of blood pressure measurements. These have been clearly listed and validated through direct extraction of the source material.

    The guidebook demonstrates eight incorrect postures for measuring blood pressure: sitting cross-legged, sitting on a low sofa or in front of a low table, placing the watch below heart level, arm not supported or bent improperly, standing or lying down, moving or shifting during measurement, wrist not aligned with heart level, and leaning forward or exerting pressure on the abdomen. These postures can lead to inaccurate readings by affecting vascular resistance, arm position, or signal acquisition.
