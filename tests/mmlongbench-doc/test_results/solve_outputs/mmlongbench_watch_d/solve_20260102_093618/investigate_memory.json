      "raw_result": "Double pressing the Down button on the HUAWEI Watch D serves as a direct shortcut to initiate a blood pressure measurement. According to the user guide, after ensuring the device is properly worn and the Blood Pressure app is accessible, users can press the Down button twice to start a measurement without needing to navigate through the app list first. This functionality is explicitly mentioned in the \"Measuring blood pressure\" section, where it states: “You can also press the Down button twice to start a measurement.” This design enables quick, one-handed access to a core health feature, aligning with the watch’s emphasis on efficient, context-sensitive interactions for health monitoring.\n\nThe behavior is context-aware and consistent with the device’s overall interface philosophy: the Down button’s default function is to launch the Blood Pressure app upon a single press (unless customized), and the double-press action extends this by bypassing the app interface entirely to begin measurement immediately. This feature is particularly useful during routine health checks, minimizing interaction steps while maintaining accuracy and user control. It is important to note that this functionality assumes the Blood Pressure app is properly configured and the wrist circumference has been set in the app settings, as outlined in the setup instructions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
