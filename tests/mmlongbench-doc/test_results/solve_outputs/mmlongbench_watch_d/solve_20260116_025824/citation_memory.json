The system appears to recognize only “Press once” and “Press and hold” as defined operations for the Down Button.\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the provided context, **the behavior of pressing the Down Button twice is not defined or supported**.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Down Button Function Mapping Table (table)\n- [2] Blood Pressure App\n- [3] Voice Assistant\n- [4] Operation Column\n- [5] Function Column",
