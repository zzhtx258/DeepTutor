      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about what happens when you press the **Down Button twice** on the HUAWEI Smartwatch or Huawei Watch D.\n\nThe available documentation describes the following behaviors for the Down Button:\n\n- **Single Press**: By default, this opens the **Blood Pressure App**, though it can be customized to launch any other app.\n- **Long Press (Hold)**: This wakes up the **Voice Assistant**, but only in certain countries or regions.\n\nThere is no mention of a “double press” operation being mapped to any specific function in the Down Button Function Mapping Table or elsewhere in the knowledge base. The system appears to recognize only “Press once” and “Press and hold” as defined operations for the Down Button.\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the provided context, **the behavior of pressing the Down Button twice is not defined or supported**.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Down Button Function Mapping Table (table)\n- [2] Blood Pressure App\n- [3] Voice Assistant\n- [4] Operation Column\n- [5] Function Column",
      "summary": "Pressing the down button twice is not defined or supported in the HUAWEI Smartwatch or Huawei Watch D user interface. The device only recognizes single press (opens Blood Pressure App) and long press (wakes Voice Assistant) for the Down Button. No double-press function is documented.",
