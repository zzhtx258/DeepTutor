      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Double-Press Functionality for the Down Button\n\nIn the HUAWEI Smartwatch and Huawei Watch D user interfaces, button interactions are explicitly defined for specific press types — namely, single press and long press — but **no functionality is assigned to a double press** of the Down Button. According to the available documentation, the Down Button supports only two recognized input modes:\n\n- **Single Press**: Opens the Blood Pressure App by default.\n- **Long Press**: Activates the Voice Assistant.\n\nThere is no mention, specification, or implementation of a “double press” action for the Down Button in any official documentation or functional description `[rag-1]`. This implies that pressing the Down Button twice in quick succession will not trigger any predefined system response or application launch. The device’s firmware does not interpret this gesture as a valid command.\n\nThis design choice likely reflects a prioritization of simplicity and clarity in user interaction, avoiding ambiguous or overlapping gestures that could lead to unintended behavior. Users should rely on the documented single press or long press actions for intended functionality.\n\nIn summary, pressing the down button twice has no defined function in the HUAWEI Smartwatch or Huawei Watch D — it is effectively ignored by the system.",
