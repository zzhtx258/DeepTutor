Here are the key functionalities associated with the Down button:\n\n1. **Default Function**: When pressed once, the Down button typically opens the Blood Pressure app, which is a primary feature for health monitoring (referenced in the context of blood pressure management).\n\n2. **Customization**: Users have the option to customize the function of the Down button. After pressing the Up button to access the app list, users can navigate to Settings and select the Down button to assign it a different app or function as per their preference (this aligns with the section on customizing the button's function).\n\n3. **Double Press Functionality**: Pressing the Down button twice is specifically mentioned as a shortcut to start a blood pressure measurement, making it a quick-access feature for users needing immediate health monitoring.\n\nThese functionalities highlight the user-centered design of the HUAWEI watch, emphasizing health monitoring and user convenience.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
