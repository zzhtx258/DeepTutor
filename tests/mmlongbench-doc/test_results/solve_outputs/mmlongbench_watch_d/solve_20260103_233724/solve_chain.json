      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Incorrect Postures for Measuring Blood Pressure\n\nIn the guidebook, three incorrect postures for measuring blood pressure are explicitly identified. These postures can significantly affect the accuracy of the readings and are as follows:\n\n1. **Sitting Cross-legged**: This position can exert pressure on the abdomen, which may interfere with the blood flow and lead to inaccurate measurements.\n\n2. **Placing the Watch Below Heart Level**: When the blood pressure monitor is positioned below the heart, it can result in artificially high readings due to the effects of gravity on blood flow.\n\n3. **Measuring While Moving**: Any movement during the measurement process can disrupt the stability required for an accurate reading, leading to unreliable results.\n\nThese incorrect postures highlight the necessity of adhering to proper techniques when measuring blood pressure to ensure reliable and valid results. It is crucial to maintain a standard measuring posture to avoid these common pitfalls.",
