Here are the key examples:\n\n1. **Sitting Cross-legged**: This posture can apply pressure on the abdomen, which is not conducive to accurate readings.\n   \n2. **Placing the Watch Below Heart Level**: Such positioning can result in misleadingly high blood pressure readings since the watch is not aligned with the heart.\n\n3. **Measuring While Moving**: Measurements taken during physical movement, such as in vehicles or elevators, can also lead to erroneous results.\n\nThe guidebook emphasizes maintaining a standard measuring posture to ensure accurate readings. This includes keeping the watch level with the heart, the arm bent, and the palm relaxed and facing upwards during the measurement. Correct posture plays a crucial role in obtaining reliable blood pressure values.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
