      "step_response": "## S1: Effect of Pressing and Holding the Down Button\n\nPressing and holding the **Down Button** on the HUAWEI Smartwatch triggers a specific system-level function: it activates the **Voice Assistant**. This is not a momentary action like a single press (which typically opens the Blood Pressure App, though customizable), but rather a sustained input designed to initiate voice-based interaction with the device.\n\nThe Voice Assistant enables users to perform tasks hands-free through spoken commands. Examples include setting reminders, checking weather forecasts, or initiating navigation — all without needing to navigate menus manually [rag-1].\n\nThis feature is region-limited, meaning its availability may vary depending on the user’s geographic location or language settings. It represents an AI-powered interface layer intended to enhance accessibility and convenience during active use or when manual interaction is impractical.\n\n### Summary\nHolding the down button activates the Voice Assistant for hands-free command execution, distinguishing it from the single-press behavior that usually launches the Blood Pressure App. This functionality is region-dependent and optimized for voice-driven task automation.",
