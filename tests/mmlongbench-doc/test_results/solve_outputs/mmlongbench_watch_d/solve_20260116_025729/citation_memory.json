This feature is designed to provide AI-powered assistance through voice commands, allowing users to interact with the device hands-free for tasks such as setting reminders, checking weather, or navigating apps.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the availability of the Voice Assistant is **region-limited** — meaning it may not be supported in all countries or regions. The functionality is mapped within the *Down Button Function Mapping Table*, which outlines how user operations (like “Press and Hold”) correspond to specific system functions.\n\nThis action is distinct from a single press of the Down Button, which by default opens the **Blood Pressure App**, though this can also be customized to launch another preferred application.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Down Button Function Mapping Table (table)\n- [2] Voice Assistant\n- [3] Assistant Section\n- [4] HUAWEI Smartwatch\n- [5] Operation Column",
