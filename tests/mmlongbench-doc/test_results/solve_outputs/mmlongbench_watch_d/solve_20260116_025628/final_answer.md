## S1: Step Count Analysis for Down Button Customization

To determine the number of steps required to customize the function of the Down Button on a HUAWEI Smartwatch, we analyze the provided knowledge base citation [rag-1]. According to the documented procedure, there are exactly **four distinct steps** involved in this customization process:

1. **Access the Settings Menu**: Navigate to the device’s main **Settings** interface, which serves as the central hub for configuring hardware and software features.
2. **Locate the Down Button Customization Option**: Within Settings, find the specific menu item or submenu dedicated to button mapping or hardware customization.
3. **Select Preferred Function from Mapping Table**: Choose the desired application or action (e.g., replacing “Blood Pressure App” with another app) from the available function list presented in the mapping table.
4. **Confirm and Save**: Finalize your selection by confirming the change and saving it to apply the new function to the Down Button.

Additionally, while not part of the core four-step customization flow, the documentation notes that long-pressing the Down Button typically activates the Voice Assistant — though this behavior may vary depending on regional settings or context. Advanced configurations may also require synchronization with the Huawei Health App, but this is an optional extension rather than a mandatory step in the basic customization sequence.

The tool execution result further corroborates this count by explicitly returning the value `4`, aligning with the structured procedural breakdown in [rag-1].

Thus, based on authoritative documentation and computational verification, **exactly 4 steps are required** to customize the function of the Down Button.

This step establishes the foundational count needed for subsequent planning or implementation phases. The next step will detail each of these four steps with operational specifics.
