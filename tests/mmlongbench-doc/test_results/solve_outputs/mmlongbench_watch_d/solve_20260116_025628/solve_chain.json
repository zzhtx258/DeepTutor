      "step_response": "## S1: Step Count Analysis for Down Button Customization\n\nTo determine the number of steps required to customize the function of the Down Button on a HUAWEI Smartwatch, we analyze the provided knowledge base citation [rag-1]. According to the documented procedure, there are exactly **four distinct steps** involved in this customization process:\n\n1. **Access the Settings Menu**: Navigate to the device’s main **Settings** interface, which serves as the central hub for configuring hardware and software features.\n2. **Locate the Down Button Customization Option**: Within Settings, find the specific menu item or submenu dedicated to button mapping or hardware customization.\n3. **Select Preferred Function from Mapping Table**: Choose the desired application or action (e.g., replacing “Blood Pressure App” with another app) from the available function list presented in the mapping table.\n4. **Confirm and Save**: Finalize your selection by confirming the change and saving it to apply the new function to the Down Button.\n\nAdditionally, while not part of the core four-step customization flow, the documentation notes that long-pressing the Down Button typically activates the Voice Assistant — though this behavior may vary depending on regional settings or context. Advanced configurations may also require synchronization with the Huawei Health App, but this is an optional extension rather than a mandatory step in the basic customization sequence.\n\nThe tool execution result further corroborates this count by explicitly returning the value `4`, aligning with the structured procedural breakdown in [rag-1].\n\nThus, based on authoritative documentation and computational verification, **exactly 4 steps are required** to customize the function of the Down Button.\n\n---\n\nThis step establishes the foundational count needed for subsequent planning or implementation phases. The next step will detail each of these four steps with operational specifics.",
