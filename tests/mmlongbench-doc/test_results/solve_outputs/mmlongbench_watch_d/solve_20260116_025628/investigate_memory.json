      "raw_result": "To customize the function of the **Down Button** on your HUAWEI Smartwatch (such as the Huawei Watch D), follow these steps based on the provided context:\n\n### 1. Access the Settings Menu\nNavigate to the **Settings** menu on your device. This is where you can configure various features, including button functions.\n\n### 2. Locate the Down Button Customization Option\nWithin the **Settings** menu, look for an option related to **button customization** or specifically labeled **Down Button**. This section allows you to assign specific functions to the Down Button.\n\n### 3. Select Your Preferred Function\nBy default, a single press of the Down Button opens the **Blood Pressure App**. However, you can customize it to launch any other app or feature of your choice. The system supports user-defined mappings through the **Down Button Function Mapping Table**, which links operations (like “Press once” or “Hold”) to specific functions.\n\n### 4. Confirm and Save Your Selection\nAfter selecting your desired function, confirm and save your changes. The new configuration will take effect immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **Long Press Function**: Holding the Down Button typically wakes up the **Voice Assistant**, though this feature may be region-limited.\n- **Contextual Awareness**: Some functions may be overridden depending on current usage (e.g., during a phone call).\n- **Integration with Huawei Health App**: While most customizations are done directly on the watch, some advanced settings or health-related configurations may require syncing with the **Huawei Health App** via Bluetooth.\n\nThis customization empowers users to tailor their smartwatch experience according to personal preferences or frequently used features.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Getting Started Section\n- [2] Down Button Function Mapping Table (table)\n- [3] Settings\n- [4] Blood Pressure Management Section\n- [5] Assistant Section",
