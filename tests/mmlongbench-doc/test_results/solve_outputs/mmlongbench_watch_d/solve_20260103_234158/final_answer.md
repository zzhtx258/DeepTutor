When the Down button on the HUAWEI watch is pressed and held, it primarily activates the voice assistant feature, known as HUAWEI Assistant. This functionality is designed to provide users with quick access to voice commands and assistance, enhancing the overall user experience. However, it is crucial to note that this feature is only available in specific countries and regions, meaning that users in unsupported areas may not have access to this functionality at all.

Additionally, users have the option to customize the Down button's default operation. This customization allows users to assign specific apps or functions to the button, enhancing quick access to health metrics and other features they may frequently use. This adaptability of the Down button not only improves user interaction but also tailors the device's functionality to better suit individual preferences.

In summary, the Down button on the HUAWEI watch serves multiple purposes depending on the situation. When pressed and held, it activates the voice assistant, but its functionality can be customized and may change during calls or workouts to ensure an uninterrupted user experience.
