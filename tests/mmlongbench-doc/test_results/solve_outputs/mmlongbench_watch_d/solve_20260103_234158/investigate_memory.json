However, it is important to note that this functionality is only supported in certain countries and regions, meaning it may not be available universally across all devices.\n\nIn addition to this primary function, the behavior of the Down button can be altered based on the context or specific modes the watch is in. For instance, during calls or workout sessions, the default functionality of the Down button might be overridden to prevent interruptions, ensuring that users can maintain focus on the task at hand without distractions from the voice assistant.\n\nIn summary, pressing and holding the Down button on the HUAWEI watch typically launches the voice assistant, but this action can be contextualized by the current activity or configurations set on the device.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
