      "raw_result": "The figure illustrates the correct placement of a Huawei smartwatch on the wrist for accurate health tracking. Specifically, it shows that the center of the smartwatch should be positioned approximately **2.5 to 3 centimeters** from the base of the palm — which corresponds to roughly **two finger widths** away from the bottom of the palm.\n\nThis measurement ensures optimal alignment with the ulnar styloid process and allows the sensor on the back of the watch to maintain unobstructed contact with the skin, which is critical for accurate heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen, and blood pressure measurements.\n\nThe exact distance indicated in the visual guide is **2.5–3 cm**, as explicitly referenced in the Smartwatch Wrist Placement Guide (image) and supported by the instructional diagrams showing alignment cues relative to anatomical landmarks.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Smartwatch Wrist Placement Guide (image)\n- [2] Smartwatch Wrist Placement Diagram (image)\n- [3] Huawei_Watch_Strap_Sizing_Guide_Diagram (image)\n- [4] Instructional Diagram\n- [5] 2.5-3 cm Measurement",
