      "step_response": "## S1: Interpreting the Figure’s Wrist Measurement Guidance\n\nThe figure referenced in the available materials provides explicit guidance on the optimal placement of a Huawei smartwatch on the wrist for accurate health tracking. According to the visual and textual instructions, the center of the watch should be positioned approximately **2.5 to 3 centimeters** from the base of the palm — a distance that corresponds to roughly **two finger widths** [rag-1].\n\nThis measurement is not arbitrary; it ensures that the optical sensors on the underside of the watch maintain proper contact with the skin, which is critical for reliable heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring. The “two finger width” rule serves as a practical, user-friendly approximation for this precise range.\n\nWhile the exact value may vary slightly depending on individual finger size, the figure standardizes the recommended distance as **2.5 to 3 cm**, which users can measure directly using the included ruler or any standard metric ruler.\n\nThus, according to the figure, the two-finger-width distance from the bottom of the palm is **2.5 to 3 centimeters**.\n\n---\n\nThis step establishes the foundational measurement needed for correct watch placement. The next step will guide how to apply this measurement practically using the ruler provided with the watch.",
