      "raw_result": "The guidebook illustrates **eight incorrect postures** for measuring blood pressure using a wrist-worn device, each clearly marked with an **‘X’** to indicate improper positioning. These incorrect postures are visually depicted in the **Illustration of Incorrect Blood Pressure Measurement Postures (image)** and are referenced textually on **Page 13** of the manual.\n\nWhile the specific visual details of each posture are not described in text within the provided context, the diagram uses a **gender-neutral, faceless human figure** to demonstrate these erroneous positions. The purpose is to warn users against adopting any of these postures, as they compromise measurement accuracy.\n\nThe only posture shown without an ‘X’ — and therefore considered correct — is **standing with the left arm bent at 90 degrees and the device positioned at heart level**. This reinforces that all other illustrated positions are incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, the **Table 2-1 Inaccurate measurement results (table)** identifies “incorrect posture” as a primary cause of inaccurate readings, with the prescribed solution being adherence to the **standard measuring posture**, which includes keeping the device at heart level.\n\nIn summary, while the exact nature of each of the eight incorrect postures isn’t detailed textually, they are visually flagged in the instructional diagram as errors to avoid, and their correction is addressed through guidance on maintaining proper alignment and stillness during measurement.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Illustration of Incorrect Blood Pressure Measurement Postures (image)\n- [2] Page 13\n- [3] Table 2-1 Inaccurate measurement results (table)\n- [4] Correct Posture for Blood Pressure Measurement\n- [5] Instructional Diagram",
