## S1: Identification and Count of Incorrect Blood Pressure Measurement Postures

Based on the provided guidebook summary, there are **eight incorrect postures** demonstrated for measuring blood pressure using a wrist-worn device. Each of these postures is visually marked with an **‘X’** in a diagram to indicate improper positioning that may lead to inaccurate readings [rag-1]. These illustrations appear on **Page 13** and are referenced in **Table 2-1** as common causes of measurement error.

Although the textual description does not detail each specific posture (e.g., arm too high, device not at heart level, etc.), the visual flagging system serves as a clear instructional warning to users. The only correct posture shown is standing with the left arm bent at 90 degrees and the device positioned at heart level — serving as the baseline for comparison against the eight incorrect variants.

This count of **8** is explicitly confirmed by both the summary and raw excerpt from the retrieval result [rag-1].

### Summary
The guidebook visually demonstrates exactly **eight incorrect postures** for blood pressure measurement using a wrist-worn device, each marked with an ‘X’ to emphasize their inaccuracy. This number is directly supported by the available materials and requires no further derivation.
