      "step_response": "## S1: Identification and Count of Incorrect Blood Pressure Measurement Postures\n\nBased on the provided guidebook summary, there are **eight incorrect postures** demonstrated for measuring blood pressure using a wrist-worn device. Each of these postures is visually marked with an **‘X’** in a diagram to indicate improper positioning that may lead to inaccurate readings [rag-1]. These illustrations appear on **Page 13** and are referenced in **Table 2-1** as common causes of measurement error.\n\nAlthough the textual description does not detail each specific posture (e.g., arm too high, device not at heart level, etc.), the visual flagging system serves as a clear instructional warning to users. The only correct posture shown is standing with the left arm bent at 90 degrees and the device positioned at heart level — serving as the baseline for comparison against the eight incorrect variants.\n\nThis count of **8** is explicitly confirmed by both the summary and raw excerpt from the retrieval result [rag-1].\n\n### Summary\nThe guidebook visually demonstrates exactly **eight incorrect postures** for blood pressure measurement using a wrist-worn device, each marked with an ‘X’ to emphasize their inaccuracy. This number is directly supported by the available materials and requires no further derivation.",
