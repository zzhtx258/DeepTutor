Press the Down button to confirm and launch the newly assigned app or feature.\n\nThis customization allows users to tailor the Down button’s default behavior, which originally launches the Blood Pressure app, to better suit individual preferences or usage patterns. Note that during active modes such as calls or workouts, the default behavior may be overridden to ensure uninterrupted functionality.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
