This function allows users to interact with the device using voice commands, enabling hands-free control for tasks such as querying information, setting reminders, or controlling other connected features. However, this functionality is subject to regional availability, as the voice assistant is only supported in certain countries or regions. \n\nIt is important to note that during specific active modes—such as incoming calls or workouts—the default behavior of the Down button may be overridden to ensure uninterrupted user experience. This design prioritizes functionality during critical activities while maintaining quick access to the voice assistant under normal conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the Down button’s default function can be customized through the device settings, allowing users to assign alternative apps or actions to the button press, though holding the button retains its dedicated voice assistant function regardless of customization.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] watch_d.pdf",
      "summary": "Pressing and holding the Down button on the HUAWEI Watch D activates the HUAWEI Assistant, enabling voice-controlled interactions for tasks like querying information, setting reminders, or controlling connected features. This function remains dedicated to the voice assistant even if the button's single-press action is customized. However, the feature may be overridden during active modes like incoming calls or workouts, and its availability depends on regional support.",
