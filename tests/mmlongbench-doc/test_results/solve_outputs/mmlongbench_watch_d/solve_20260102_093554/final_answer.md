## S1: Function of Pressing and Holding the Down Button on HUAWEI Watch D

Pressing and holding the Down button on the HUAWEI Watch D is designed to activate the **HUAWEI Assistant**, a voice-controlled intelligent interface that enables hands-free interaction with the device [rag-1]. This action triggers the assistant to listen for voice commands, allowing users to perform a range of tasks without touching the screen, such as querying weather or calendar information, setting reminders, sending messages, or controlling connected smart home devices [rag-1].

Importantly, this functionality is **dedicated and immutable**—even if the user has customized the single-press action of the Down button (e.g., to launch a specific app or toggle a feature), the long-press behavior remains fixed to activate the HUAWEI Assistant. This design ensures consistent access to voice control regardless of user-specific button configurations [rag-1].

However, there are two key contextual exceptions to this behavior:
1. **During active modes**: If the watch is engaged in an ongoing activity—such as an incoming phone call, a workout session, or a guided breathing exercise—the long-press function may be temporarily suspended to prevent interference with critical user interactions [rag-1].
2. **Regional dependency**: The availability of the HUAWEI Assistant—and thus the long-press functionality—is subject to regional service support. In certain markets where HUAWEI services are restricted or not localized, the voice assistant may be disabled or unavailable, rendering the long-press action inert [rag-1].

In summary, the long-press action on the Down button serves as a reliable, always-available gateway to voice control, but its effectiveness is contingent on both the current operational context of the device and the geographic availability of HUAWEI’s cloud-based services.

    Pressing and holding the Down button on the HUAWEI Watch D activates the HUAWEI Assistant, enabling voice-controlled interactions for tasks like querying information, setting reminders, or controlling connected features. This function remains dedicated to the voice assistant even if the button's single-press action is customized. However, the feature may be overridden during active modes like incoming calls or workouts, and its availability depends on regional support.
