## S1: Analysis of Available Data for Population Comparison in 2018

To determine whether **Republicans who are Hispanic** or **No Lean individuals who are male** constitute a larger population group in 2018, we must first establish whether the available documents contain the specific demographic percentages required for this comparison.

After conducting multiple targeted queries across the knowledge base and reviewing all provided materials — including references to the 2018 Pew Research Center demographic profile table — it is evident that **no exact numerical percentages or population figures** are reported for either subgroup:

- For **Hispanic Republicans**, while the context confirms that Republicans are predominantly White (83%) [rag-1], no breakdown by ethnicity within the Republican party is provided for 2018. The existence of such a category is acknowledged, but its quantitative value remains unspecified.
  
- For **Male No Lean individuals**, although the “No Lean” subgroup is defined as politically independent with no partisan leaning, and although Independents overall skew more male (56% male) [rag-2], there is no gender-specific breakdown for the *No Lean* subgroup alone. The sample size for this group is noted as small (N=93), further indicating limited granularity in reporting.

Moreover, repeated attempts to extract data from the referenced **Demographic Profile of Political Affiliation Groups (2018 Pew Data)** table have failed to yield the requested cross-tabulated values for these two subgroups [rag-3–rag-7]. The only cited document, PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf, pertains to a 2016 report on Latino economic perceptions and does not contain the 2018 political affiliation data needed for this analysis.

Therefore, based strictly on the evidence available in the provided materials, **it is not possible to calculate or compare the population sizes** of these two groups in 2018.

### Conclusion:
The question cannot be answered with the current dataset. Neither the percentage of Republicans who are Hispanic nor the percentage of No Lean individuals who are male is explicitly stated or derivable from the given information. A direct comparison requires access to the original 2018 Pew Research Center table with full cross-tabulations — which is not included in the available materials.

## S2: Conclusion on Data Insufficiency for Population Comparison

Based on the comprehensive review of all available materials, it is formally concluded that **a valid comparison between the population sizes of “Republicans who are Hispanic” and “No Lean individuals who are male” in 2018 cannot be made**. This conclusion is not due to methodological failure or analytical oversight, but rather stems directly from the **absence of required demographic data** within the provided documents.

The core limitation lies in the fact that neither subgroup’s population proportion is explicitly reported or derivable from the existing information:

- For **Hispanic Republicans**, while the broader racial composition of Republicans is noted (e.g., 83% White) [rag-1], no ethnic breakdown — including Hispanic representation — is provided for this group in 2018.
  
- For **Male No Lean individuals**, although Independents overall show a gender skew (56% male) [rag-2], the “No Lean” subgroup — which constitutes only 93 respondents (N=93) — lacks any published gender-specific tabulation. The small sample size further suggests that such granular data was either not collected or not reported.

Furthermore, attempts to extract cross-tabulated values from the referenced 2018 Pew Research Center demographic profile table have yielded no usable figures for these specific intersections [rag-3–rag-7]. The sole cited external document, PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf, pertains to Latino economic attitudes in 2016 and does not contain the political affiliation data needed for this analysis.

Thus, without access to the original 2018 Pew dataset with full demographic cross-tabulations, **any attempt to quantify or compare these two groups would constitute speculation**, violating the principle of evidence-based reasoning.

In summary, the inability to answer this question reflects a limitation of the source material itself — not an analytical shortcoming. To resolve this, one would need direct access to the underlying survey microdata or a published report containing the exact percentages for these subgroups. Until then, the comparison remains **not answerable based on current evidence**.

    The specific percentage of males within the 'No Lean' group in 2018 is not available in the provided context. While Independents overall skew more male (56% male), this aggregate figure does not isolate the 'No Lean' subgroup, which has a small sample size (N=93) and lacks detailed gender breakdowns. No data is provided for Republican Hispanics in 2018 for comparison.
