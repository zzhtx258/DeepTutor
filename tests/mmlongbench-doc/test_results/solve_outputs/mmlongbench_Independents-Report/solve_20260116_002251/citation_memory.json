      "raw_result": "The 2018 Pew Research Center data provides a comprehensive demographic breakdown of U.S. adults by political affiliation, including gender, race/ethnicity, age, and education. However, the specific percentages for **Republicans who are Hispanic** and **No Lean individuals who are male** are not directly stated in the available context.\n\n### Key Findings from the 2018 Demographic Profile:\n\n- The **Demographic Profile of Political Affiliation Groups (2018 Pew Data)** table organizes U.S. adults across political affiliations (Republican, Democrat, Independent, Lean Rep, Lean Dem, No Lean) by demographic variables such as **gender, race/ethnicity, age, and education**.\n  \n- **Race/Ethnicity Categories**: Include White, Black, Hispanic, and Other — allowing for cross-tabulation with political affiliation.\n\n- **Gender Breakdown**: The table includes separate columns for Male and Female respondents within each political group.\n\n- **No Lean Group**: This refers to true independents with no partisan leaning. While their demographic characteristics are included in the table, specific percentages for **male No Lean individuals** are not extracted in the provided knowledge base.\n\n- **Hispanic Republicans**: Although the report analyzes Latino economic attitudes and political views separately, it does not explicitly state the percentage of **Republicans who identify as Hispanic** in the 2018 political affiliation table. The report on Latinos (reference [1]) focuses on their economic perceptions and does not integrate this into the partisan demographic table.\n\n---\n\n### Limitations Based on Available Context:\n\n- While the **Demographic Profile of Political Affiliation Groups (2018 Pew Data) (table)** exists and is referenced multiple times, the actual numerical values or percentages for subgroups like “Hispanic Republicans” or “Male No Lean” are not included in the knowledge graph or document chunks.\n\n- The **Pew Research Center** produces these tables, but without access to the full dataset or visual chart, we cannot extract exact figures for your requested categories.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Next Steps:\n\nTo obtain the precise percentages you’re seeking:\n1. Access the original **“Demographic Profile of Political Affiliation Groups (2018 Pew Data)”** table published by Pew Research Center.\n2. Cross-reference the **race/ethnicity** column for “Hispanic” under the “Republican” row.\n3. Locate the **gender** column for “Male” under the “No Lean” row.\n\nThese details are likely contained in the full report or interactive data tool available on the Pew Research Center website.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
