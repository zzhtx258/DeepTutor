## S1: Calculation of the Percentage of Democrats Who Voted in the 2018 Election

To determine the percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2018 election relative to the entire population, we will utilize the turnout rate of Democrats and the percentage of Democrats in the population. 

From the available data, we know that:
- The turnout rate of Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections was approximately 59% [rag-1].
- In 2018, 31% of the U.S. population identified as Democrats [rag-2].

Using these figures, we can calculate the percentage of Democrats who voted in the election with the following formula:

$$
\text{Percentage of Democrats who voted} = \text{Democrat turnout rate} \times \text{Percentage of Democrats in population}
$$

Substituting in the known values:

$$
\text{Percentage of Democrats who voted} = 0.59 \times 0.31
$$

Upon executing this calculation, we find:

$$
\text{Percentage of Democrats who voted} = 0.1839
$$

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

$$
\text{Percentage of Democrats who voted} = 0.1839 \times 100 = 18.29\%
$$

Thus, the percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2018 election compared to the entire population is **18.29%**. This figure highlights the significant engagement of Democrats in the electoral process during that election cycle, reflecting their turnout relative to their representation in the overall population.

## S2: Analysis of the Percentage of Democrats Who Voted in the 2018 Election

The calculated percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2018 election, which stands at **18.29%**, provides significant insights into the voting behavior of this demographic. Understanding this percentage is crucial for evaluating the engagement levels of Democrats during the midterm elections.

### Implications of the Voting Percentage

1. **Voter Engagement**: A percentage of **18.29%** indicates a notable level of engagement among Democrats relative to their overall representation in the population. This level of turnout suggests that there was effective mobilization within the party, likely driven by various factors such as campaign strategies, key issues at stake, and the political climate leading up to the elections.

2. **Party Loyalty and Mobilization**: The relatively high turnout rate of Democrats, at **59%**, reflects strong party loyalty. This loyalty can be attributed to several elements, including grassroots organizing, targeted outreach efforts, and the appeal of Democratic candidates and policies during the election cycle. The engagement of Democrats in the electoral process is indicative of their commitment to influencing political outcomes.

3. **Challenges in Voter Turnout**: While **18.29%** is a significant figure, it also raises questions about the challenges faced by Democrats in mobilizing their entire base. Factors such as voter disillusionment, barriers to voting, or competing interests may have impacted the turnout of Democrats who did not participate. Understanding these challenges is essential for future electoral strategies.

4. **Campaign Strategy Effectiveness**: Analyzing this percentage allows political analysts and campaign strategists to assess the effectiveness of their outreach and mobilization efforts. A higher turnout among Democrats could suggest that the strategies employed were successful, while a lower turnout could indicate areas needing improvement.

5. **Overall Political Climate**: The percentage of Democrats who voted also reflects the broader political climate during the 2018 midterms. High engagement levels may correlate with heightened political awareness and activism among Democrats, particularly in response to national issues and events that mobilized voters.

In conclusion, the **18.29%** figure not only quantifies the participation of Democrats in the 2018 election but also serves as a lens through which we can analyze their voting behavior, party dynamics, and the effectiveness of campaign strategies. This analysis is vital for understanding the electoral landscape and preparing for future elections.
