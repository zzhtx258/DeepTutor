Here’s a summary of the types of visual data included:\n\n### Key Visual Data from the Report\n\n1. **Demographic Breakdown of Political Identity Groups**:\n   - This table provides a comprehensive demographic analysis by gender, race, age, and education across political identity groups like Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. The data illustrates significant trends such as the majority of Independents being male (56%) and younger on average compared to partisans (reference_id: 1).\n\n2. **Political Attitudes Toward Parties**:\n   - A vertical bar chart depicts that a predominant share of Americans hold favorable views toward one party while unfavorably toward the other (66%). This chart reveals increasing polarization in political attitudes since 2015 (reference_id: 1).\n\n3. **Support for Social Issues**:\n   - Horizontal bar charts show support for same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization across political affiliations. Notably, a large majority of Independents support both issues, with a significant portion favoring legalization (70% for marijuana, 65% for same-sex marriage among non-leaning Independents) (reference_id: 1).\n\n4. **Voter Participation Among Independents**:\n   - A comparative analysis showing lower voter registration and turnout among non-leaning independents, emphasizing their lesser political engagement relative to partisan identifiers (reference_id: 1).\n\n5. **Unfavorable Views of Both Parties**:\n   - The stacked bar chart highlights that Independents who do not lean toward a party are most likely to have unfavorable views of both major parties, with the highest percentage of dual-negative views recorded (37%) (reference_id: 1).\n\nThese visuals effectively communicate the shifting dynamics within U.S. political identities, showcasing the demographic characteristics and political attitudes of Independents as compared to partisans, in a detailed and structured manner.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
