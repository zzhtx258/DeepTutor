      "raw_result": "According to the 2018 data from the Pew Research Center, **59% of Democrats** reported that they voted in the 2018 midterm elections. This figure is derived from self-reported voting behavior collected via the American Trends Panel survey conducted in November 2018.\n\nThis level of turnout among Democrats was higher than that of true independents (who do not lean toward either party), but slightly lower than that of Republicans (61%). The data also show that Democratic-leaning independents had a turnout rate of 48%, indicating that formal party identifiers tend to be more politically engaged at the ballot box than those who only lean toward a party without formally identifying with it.\n\nThe findings underscore a broader pattern: while many political independents exist, most are not truly disengaged — rather, they typically align with one party or the other and participate in elections at rates comparable to partisans. True independents — those with no partisan lean — showed significantly lower engagement, with only 33% reporting they voted in 2018.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

The data also mentions voting registration rates among Democrats (76%) but does not link this to the total adult population.
