The referenced chart and table group political affiliation broadly (e.g., “Democrat,” “Lean Dem”), without isolating “pure” identifiers. Although a stacked area chart image was mentioned, its visual content wasn’t accessible to extract specific values — thus, no image interpretation could be performed. The Knowledge Graph noted 76% of Democrats registered to vote in 2018, but this does not reflect their share of the total adult population. **Conclusion: The requested percentage is not available in the given materials.**",

          "raw_answer": "Based on the provided context, here is the information regarding U.S. adults who identified as Democrats in 2018 and their voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election:\n\n### Percentage of U.S. Adults Identifying as Democrats in 2018\n\nThe context does not provide a direct percentage of U.S. adults who identified as Democrats in 2018. However, it does indicate that **76% of those who identify as Democrats reported being registered to vote** in the 2018 midterms. This suggests a high level of formal party affiliation among self-identified Democrats, but it does not specify what proportion of the total U.S. adult population this group represents.\n\nAdditionally, the context notes that **Democrats (including leaners)** made up a significant portion of the electorate, with trends showing increasing liberal identification among them — reaching **47% identifying as liberal in 2018**. But again, this reflects ideological self-identification rather than the overall share of the U.S. adult population identifying as Democrats.\n\n---\n\n### Voter Turnout Rate Among Democrats in the 2018 Midterm Election\n\nAccording to the data presented:\n\n> **59% of self-reported Democrats voted in the 2018 midterm elections.**\n\nThis figure comes from survey data collected via the American Trends Panel by the Pew Research Center between November 7–16, 2018. The data also shows that while 76% of Democrats were registered to vote, only 59% actually reported voting — indicating a gap between registration and participation.\n\nFor comparison:\n- **Republicans**: 61% turnout\n- **Democratic-leaning independents**: 48% turnout\n- **Republican-leaning independents**: 54% turnout\n- **True independents (“No Lean”)**: Only 33% turnout\n\nThese figures highlight that while Democrats had high registration rates, their actual turnout was lower than Republicans’ but higher than both leaning and true independents.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Percentage of U.S. adults identifying as Democrats in 2018**: Not directly stated in the context.\n- **Voter turnout among self-identified Democrats in the 2018 midterms**: **59%**\n\nThe data underscores strong partisan engagement among Democrats, though turnout lagged slightly behind Republicans. True independents showed significantly lower levels of political participation.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
