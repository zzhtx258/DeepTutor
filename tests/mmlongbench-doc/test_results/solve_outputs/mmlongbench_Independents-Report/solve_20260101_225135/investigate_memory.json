      "raw_result": "The provided context includes multiple charts and data visualizations related to independents who do not lean toward either party (referred to as “no lean” or “non-lean” independents). While these charts present detailed percentages for various attitudes—such as favorability toward parties, views on government size, immigration, and policy issues—they consistently include footnotes stating that “Don’t know responses not shown.” This indicates that the percentages displayed in the charts are calculated only from respondents who expressed a clear opinion, excluding those who selected “Don’t know” or declined to answer.\n\nFor example:\n- In the stacked bar chart titled *“Independents who do not lean toward a party are more likely to have unfavorable views of both parties,”* the footnote explicitly states: *“Note: Don’t know responses not shown.”*\n- Similarly, the chart *“Independents' views of race, immigrants, gender”* includes the same footnote, clarifying that non-responses are omitted from the displayed data.\n- The table on demographics and the chart on views of the U.S.-Mexico border wall also contain footnotes reiterating that “Don’t know responses not shown,” with additional notes specifying small or insufficient sample sizes for non-leaners on certain issues (e.g., N=88 for immigration views, insufficient for tariff and tax law analysis).\n\nHowever, none of the charts or accompanying text provide the absolute count or percentage of respondents in the “no lean” group who selected “Don’t know” or did not express an opinion. The data presented is limited to those who did express a view, and the total number of non-responses remains unquantified in the provided materials.\n\nTherefore, while the charts reflect the distribution of opinions among non-lean independents who responded, they do not supply the count or proportion of non-opinions (i.e., “Don’t know” responses) within this subgroup.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The report contains multiple charts, all of which are derived from Pew Research Center survey data and visually represent political attitudes and behaviors among different groups of independents. Based on the provided document chunks, there are **12 distinct charts** explicitly described in the content:\n\n1. *Independents who do not lean to a party less likely to say they voted in 2018* – Compares registration and voting rates across five groups, including “independents who do not lean toward either party.”\n2. *Independents outnumber Republicans and Democrats, but few are truly independent* – Shows percentages of “Independent (no lean)” alongside other groups.\n3. *Support for Same-Sex Marriage and Marijuana Legalization by Political Affiliation* – Includes “non-lean independents” as a distinct category.\n4. *Independents divided in opinions about the size of government, government regulation of business* – Includes “non-leaning independents” as one of the four groups.\n5. *Independents who do not lean toward a party are more likely to have unfavorable views of both parties* – Focuses exclusively on the “no lean” group, showing their attitudes toward both parties.\n6. *Political Ideology Among Independents* – Separates “Independents who lean to a party” from “Independents who do not lean to a party” in two panels.\n7. *Unfavorable views of both parties among independents* – Compares “No lean,” “Dem. leaners,” “Rep. leaners,” and “All independents” across 2015 and 2023.\n8. *Views of immigrants’ impact on the country* – Includes “non-leaning independents” as a group, though with a small sample size noted.\n9. *Independents' views of race, immigrants, gender* – Contrasts “Independents who do not lean toward a party” with “Partisan leaners.”\n10. *Trump’s job approval rating among independents, 2017–2018* – Includes “Independents with no lean” as a separate category.\n11. *Independents' views of U.S.-Mexico border wall, other key issues* – Segments data for “Republican-leaning,” “Democratic-leaning,” and “non-leaners” (though sample size for non-leaners was insufficient for some issues).\n12. *Most Americans feel favorably toward one party, unfavorably toward the other* – Aggregate data, but contextually linked to breakdowns involving the “no lean” group.\n\nAll 12 charts either explicitly include or are directly contextualized by the “no lean” (non-lean) subgroup. In fact, **10 of the 12 charts specifically segment or compare the “no lean” group** as a distinct category. The remaining two charts (immigrants’ impact and border wall) mention the “no lean” group but note small or insufficient sample sizes for analysis in some cases, yet still include them in the visual representation.\n\nThus, the charts are consistently segmented by the “no lean” group, reflecting the report’s central focus on distinguishing politically disengaged true independents from partisan-leaning independents.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
      "summary": "Out of the 12 charts in the report, all include the 'no lean' group in some form, but 10 charts specifically segment or compare the 'no lean' group as a distinct category. The remaining two charts mention the 'no lean' group but note insufficient sample sizes for analysis on certain issues, yet still visually represent them. There are no charts that provide no opinions or exclude the 'no lean' group entirely.",
