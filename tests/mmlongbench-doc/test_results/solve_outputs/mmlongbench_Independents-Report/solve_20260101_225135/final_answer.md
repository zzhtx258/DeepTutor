## S1: Analysis of 'No Lean' Group Responses with No Opinion

To determine whether any charts in the report provide data on respondents from the “no lean” group who expressed no opinion—such as selecting “Don’t know”—we must examine both the visual content and accompanying metadata of the charts. According to the available materials, all charts presented focus exclusively on respondents who expressed a clear opinion, such as favorability toward political parties or agreement with specific statements [rag-1]. 

Crucially, the footnotes accompanying these charts explicitly state that “Don’t know” responses are not shown in the visualizations [rag-1]. This indicates a deliberate exclusion of non-response categories from the displayed data. Furthermore, no quantitative metrics—neither absolute counts nor percentages—are provided for respondents in the “no lean” group who declined to answer or selected “Don’t know.” The absence of such data is not an oversight but a documented design choice in the report’s methodology.

Since the tool execution results corroborate this finding—stating unequivocally that “no charts in the report provide data on respondents from the ‘no lean’ group who expressed no opinion”—we can conclude that zero charts include any representation of non-opinion responses from this subgroup. The data presented is therefore limited to those who expressed a definitive stance, and no inference about the size or distribution of non-response within the “no lean” group is possible from the given materials.

In summary, the report’s charts do not include, nor do they enable the calculation of, any count of “no lean” respondents who selected “Don’t know” or otherwise refrained from expressing an opinion. All visualized data pertains solely to respondents with clear views.

## S2: Analysis of 'No Lean' Group Inclusion Across Charts

To address whether any charts in the report exclude or fail to represent opinions from the “no lean” group, we must examine both the scope of inclusion and the representation fidelity of this subgroup across all visualizations. According to the available materials, the report consists of exactly 12 distinct charts, all derived from Pew Research Center survey data and designed to capture political attitudes among independent voter segments [rag-2]. Crucially, every one of these 12 charts includes the “no lean” group in some form—whether as a standalone category, a comparative baseline, or a component of a broader independent voter analysis [rag-2]. 

Furthermore, while 10 of the 12 charts explicitly segment the “no lean” group for direct comparison with other subgroups (e.g., “Democratic lean” or “Republican lean”), the remaining two charts still visually represent the “no lean” group despite noting insufficient sample sizes for statistically robust analysis on certain specific issues [rag-2]. This distinction is critical: the absence of statistical significance does not equate to exclusion. In both cases, the group is present in the visualization, even if its margins of error are wider or its comparative insights are limited. The tool execution results confirm this explicitly: “All 12 charts in the report include the ‘no lean’ group in some form. None of the charts exclude or fail to represent opinions from this group.” This statement aligns with the methodological transparency of the report, which consistently accounts for all major independent voter categories, even when sample constraints affect precision.

Importantly, this finding contrasts with the earlier observation in S1 that “Don’t know” responses are excluded from all charts—not because the “no lean” group is omitted, but because non-opinion responses (e.g., “Don’t know”) are systematically filtered out across all groups, including “no lean” [rag-1]. The inclusion of the “no lean” group is not in question; rather, the representation of *non-opinion responses within* that group is what is absent. Thus, while the “no lean” group is fully represented in terms of its composition and preferences, the subset of individuals within it who selected “Don’t know” remains invisible—consistent with the report’s design principle of visualizing only expressed opinions.

In summary, all 12 charts include the “no lean” group, and none exclude or fail to represent opinions from this group. The group is consistently present, though the granularity of its representation varies depending on sample size and analytical focus.

## S3: Integration — Concluding the Number of Charts Providing No Opinions from the 'No Lean' Group

Having established the foundational findings from S1 and S2, we now synthesize these insights to directly answer the question: *How many charts provide no opinions from the “no lean” group?*

From S1, we determined that **no chart in the report includes data on respondents from the “no lean” group who expressed no opinion**—that is, those who selected “Don’t know” or otherwise refrained from voicing a stance. This exclusion is not incidental but systematic: all charts explicitly omit non-opinion responses, as confirmed by footnotes stating, “Don’t know responses not shown” [rag-1]. Consequently, even within the “no lean” group, the subset of individuals who did not express an opinion remains invisible in the visualizations.

From S2, we confirmed that **all 12 charts in the report include the “no lean” group** as a defined and represented category—either as a primary comparison group (in 10 charts) or as a visually present, albeit statistically limited, subgroup (in the remaining 2) [rag-2]. Crucially, inclusion of the group does not imply inclusion of *all* its responses; it means the group is accounted for in the survey’s structure and visualization, but only those members who expressed a clear opinion are displayed.

Therefore, the critical distinction lies in the difference between *group inclusion* and *response representation*. While every chart includes the “no lean” group, **none** of them represent the subset of that group who provided no opinion. The tool execution result explicitly confirms this synthesis: *“All 12 charts in the report include the ‘no lean’ group, but none provide any data on respondents who expressed no opinion ('Don’t know')”*.

Thus, the number of charts that provide no opinions from the “no lean” group is not zero—it is **all 12**. Each chart, while representing the “no lean” group as a whole, filters out non-opinion responses uniformly across all subgroups, leaving no chart with data on “Don’t know” responses from this cohort.

In summary, although the “no lean” group is fully represented in all 12 charts, the absence of non-opinion data applies universally—meaning every single chart provides no opinions from the “no lean” group.

    None of the charts provide the count of respondents from the 'no lean' group who selected 'Don't know' or did not express an opinion. The charts only display data from those who expressed a clear view, with footnotes explicitly stating that 'Don't know responses not shown,' but no absolute numbers for non-responses are given.

    Out of the 12 charts in the report, all include the 'no lean' group in some form, but 10 charts specifically segment or compare the 'no lean' group as a distinct category. The remaining two charts mention the 'no lean' group but note insufficient sample sizes for analysis on certain issues, yet still visually represent them. There are no charts that provide no opinions or exclude the 'no lean' group entirely.
