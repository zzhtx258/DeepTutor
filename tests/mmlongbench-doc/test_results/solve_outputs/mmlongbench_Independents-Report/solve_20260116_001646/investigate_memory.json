The data indicates that while 76% of Democrats reported being registered to vote, only 59% claimed they actually voted in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThis information is visually represented in the “Voter Registration and Turnout by Political Affiliation Group” bar chart, where the gold segment (representing those who voted) for Democrats corresponds to 59%.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

This figure is based on self-reported turnout and does not reflect the 2024 election or the entire population. The data also notes that 76% of Democrats reported being registered to vote.
