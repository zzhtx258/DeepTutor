      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, **no chart exclusively displays data from the 'No Lean' group without including other political groups**.\n\nThe available information consistently shows that charts from the Pew Research Center — such as bar charts, stacked bar charts, horizontal bar charts, and line charts — present comparative data across multiple political affiliation categories. These typically include:\n\n- **Total**\n- **Republican**\n- **Democrat**\n- **Independent (overall)**\n- **Lean Rep** (Republican-leaning independents)\n- **Lean Dem** (Democratic-leaning independents)\n- **No Lean** (true independents with no party leaning)\n\nEven when “No Lean” is highlighted or analyzed specifically (e.g., for voter turnout, policy views, or demographic characteristics), it is always presented **alongside or in contrast to** other groups like Lean Rep, Lean Dem, Republicans, or Democrats.\n\nFor example:\n- The **Voter Registration and Turnout by Political Affiliation Group (image)** includes “No Lean” alongside Lean Rep, Lean Dem, Republican, and Democrat.\n- The **Pew Research Center Bar Chart on Public Support for Same-Sex Marriage and Marijuana Legalization** includes “No Lean” as one category among others.\n- The **Pew Research Center Chart on Government Size and Regulation Preferences** also includes “No Lean” within a broader comparison of political affiliations.\n\nAdditionally, some analyses note that “No Lean” has a small sample size (N=93), which sometimes leads to data being marked as N/A or excluded for certain issues — but this does not mean a standalone chart exists for this group alone.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are **no charts in the report that show data exclusively from the 'No Lean' group**. All visualizations involving “No Lean” do so within a comparative framework that includes other political affiliation groups.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
