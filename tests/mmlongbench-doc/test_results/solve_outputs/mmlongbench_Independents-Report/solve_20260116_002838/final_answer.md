## Detailed Answer

## S1: Analysis of Chart Composition Regarding the "No Lean" Group

Based on the available materials, specifically the summary from the RAG query [rag-1], there are **zero charts** in the report that provide data exclusively from the “No Lean” group without including any other political affiliation groups.

The report consistently presents the “No Lean” category in comparative contexts — typically alongside Republican, Democrat, Lean Rep, and Lean Dem groups — using visual formats such as bar charts, stacked bar charts, horizontal bar charts, and line graphs. Even when “No Lean” is visually emphasized or highlighted within a chart, it is never isolated in a standalone visualization that excludes all other political affiliations.

This design choice reflects the analytical intent of the report: to contextualize the “No Lean” group’s responses relative to other political leanings, rather than presenting them in isolation.

### Summary
No chart in the report isolates the “No Lean” group; all relevant charts include comparative data from other political affiliation categories. Therefore, the number of charts providing *only* “No Lean” opinions is exactly 0.
