Even when “No Lean” is visually emphasized or highlighted within a chart, it is never isolated in a standalone visualization that excludes all other political affiliations.\n\nThis design choice reflects the analytical intent of the report: to contextualize the “No Lean” group’s responses relative to other political leanings, rather than presenting them in isolation.\n\n### Summary\nNo chart in the report isolates the “No Lean” group; all relevant charts include comparative data from other political affiliation categories. Therefore, the number of charts providing *only* “No Lean” opinions is exactly 0.",
