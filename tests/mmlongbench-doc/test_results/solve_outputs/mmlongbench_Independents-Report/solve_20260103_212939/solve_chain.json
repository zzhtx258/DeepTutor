This statistic is significant as it highlights the minority representation within the Republican party, which was predominantly White at 83% and included Black individuals at 2% as well. The representation of Hispanic individuals at 7% indicates a growing diversity within the party, albeit still a minority compared to the overall composition.\n\nTo further evaluate which group has a greater population in 2018, we need to compare this percentage with the population of males who identified as \"no lean\" (those who do not affiliate with either major political party). However, the specific percentage or population number for males in the \"no lean\" category is not provided in the current context. Hence, we cannot definitively conclude which group is greater in population without that additional data.\n\nIn summary, while we have established that 7% of Republicans identified as Hispanic in 2018, further information is required to make a direct comparison with the male \"no lean\" population.",

According to the available data, 56% of the total non-leaning independents identified as Independents, indicating a significant representation within this political category.\n\nAlthough we do not have precise figures for the Hispanic population among non-leaning independents, it is important to consider that this group is described as more diverse compared to Republicans. The Republican demographic, as previously established, includes 7% who identified as Hispanic. This relatively low percentage suggests that the Republican party has less diversity compared to the non-leaning independents.\n\nGiven the broader diversity among non-leaning independents, it can be inferred that their male population is likely substantial and may exceed the Republican Hispanic population. This inference is supported by the notion that diversity often correlates with a higher representation of minority groups, including Hispanics, within a given demographic.\n\nIn summary, while we lack specific Hispanic statistics for non-leaning independents, the evidence suggests that their overall male population is likely greater than that of Hispanic Republicans in 2018, primarily due to the noted diversity within the non-leaning independent group.",
