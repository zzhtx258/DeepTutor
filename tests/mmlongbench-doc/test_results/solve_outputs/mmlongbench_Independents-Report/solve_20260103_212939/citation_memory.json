      "raw_result": "In the 2018 Pew Research Center survey data, the demographic breakdown for political identity groups offers insights into the population of Republicans and their Hispanic identification compared to non-leaning independents who are male.\n\n- **Republicans**: Among Republicans, the demographic is predominantly White at 83%, with a small representation of Black (2%) and Hispanic individuals (7%). This indicates that 7% of Republicans identify as Hispanic.\n\n- **Non-Leaning Independents (Males)**: Within the male population of non-leaning independents, the data reflects a more balanced representation across various demographics. Specifically, the total share of males who identify as Independents is 56%, which includes various racial and ethnic backgrounds without a specified percentage for Hispanic identifications. However, the overall trends indicate that Hispanics make up a larger portion of the independent demographic than they do in the Republican group.\n\nThus, to summarize, while 7% of Republicans are identified as Hispanic, the population of males who do not lean toward any party encompasses a broader spectrum of demographic diversity, though specific Hispanic statistics for that subgroup are not detailed in the 2018 data.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
