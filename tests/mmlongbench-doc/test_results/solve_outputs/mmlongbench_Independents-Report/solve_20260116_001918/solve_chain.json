      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Available Data for Democratic Approval Ratings\n\nTo determine whether any of the three presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, or Barack Obama — experienced a 5% increase in Democratic approval ratings between their first and last years in office, we must first establish whether the required data exists within the available materials.\n\nThe core requirement is access to **exact numerical approval percentages** among Democrats for each president during two specific time points: their **first year** and **last year** of presidency. Without these paired values, no meaningful comparison or percentage change calculation can be performed.\n\n### Review of Available Materials\n\nMultiple targeted queries were executed against the knowledge base to locate such data:\n\n- Query [rag-1] sought complete table/chart data showing Democratic support rates for all three presidents across their first and last years — **no relevant information found**.\n- Query [rag-2] specifically asked for exact approval percentages from any chart or table — again, **no numerical breakdown provided**.\n- Query [rag-3] referenced a potential Pew Research chart but confirmed that **only general trends among independents** were mentioned, not Democratic-specific figures.\n- Queries [rag-4] and [rag-5] explicitly requested **exact Democratic approval percentages** from the referenced Pew chart — both returned **negative results**, noting that available data pertains to independents or general partisan trends, not Democrats.\n\nFurthermore, tool execution results confirm that **no documents contain the specific Democratic approval ratings** needed to compute the requested 5% increase metric.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on exhaustive search and verification across five distinct RAG queries and supporting tool outputs, **the necessary data does not exist in the available materials**. There are no recorded Democratic approval percentages for Clinton, G.W. Bush, or Obama in their first and last years of presidency that would allow us to calculate or verify a 5% increase.\n\nTherefore, this question cannot be answered with the current dataset.\n\n**Final Determination**: Not answerable due to absence of required numerical data.",
