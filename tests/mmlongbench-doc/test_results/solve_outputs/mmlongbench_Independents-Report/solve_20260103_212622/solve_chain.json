Multiple queries have returned the same conclusion, emphasizing the lack of detailed statistics about voter turnout among Democrats and the overall population figures for that year. This absence of data means we cannot perform a quantitative analysis or derive any meaningful percentages.\n\nIn political analysis, understanding voter turnout is crucial, as it can significantly influence election outcomes and party strategies. However, without concrete numbers or reliable estimates, any attempt to calculate the percentage would be speculative at best. \n\nThus, we conclude that, based on the current information, we are unable to provide a definitive answer to the question of the percentage of Democrats who voted in the last election compared to the entire population in 2024. Further research and data collection would be necessary to obtain the required insights.\n\nIn summary, the analysis reveals a clear gap in the available data, preventing us from making any conclusive statements regarding the voting behavior of Democrats in the last election relative to the total population in 2024.",

The repeated queries have consistently highlighted this gap, confirming that there are no concrete statistics or reliable estimates available to perform such a calculation.\n\nThe inability to access specific voter turnout data for Democrats, as well as the overall population figures for 2024, underscores the challenges in political analysis. Voter turnout is a critical factor that can shape electoral outcomes and inform party strategies, yet without accurate data, any attempt to derive a meaningful percentage would be purely speculative.\n\nThus, we must conclude that, based on the current information, we are unable to provide a definitive answer regarding the percentage of Democrats who participated in the last election in relation to the total population in 2024. Further research and data collection are essential to gain the insights needed for a comprehensive understanding of this electoral dynamic.",
