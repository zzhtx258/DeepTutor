      "raw_result": "In the provided context, there are multiple instances where charts or data omit opinions from the group identified as \"no lean\" independents. Here are specific mentions:\n\n1. **Political Ideology Among Independents**: A stacked bar chart titled \"Political Ideology Among Independents\" illustrates the distribution of ideological self-identifications among independents who lean toward a party and those who do not lean. However, it specifies that \"don't know\" responses are not shown for this chart, implying limited data representation for the no lean group ([1]).\n\n2. **Views on U.S.-Mexico Border Wall and Other Issues**: A horizontal bar chart titled \"Independents' views of U.S.-Mexico border wall, other key issues\" notes that for the issues of tariffs and tax law, the sample size of non-leaning independents was insufficient for analysis, therefore no opinions from this group are indicated in the visual representation ([1]).\n\n3. **Impact of Immigrants**: In a chart depicting views on immigrants' impact on the country, it is mentioned that for non-leaning independents, the sample size was small, leading to insufficient data for a detailed analysis on their opinion ([1]).\n\nThese instances collectively suggest that the \"no lean\" group was excluded from certain analyses and presentations due to low sample sizes or the need for clarity in the presentation of results. \n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
      "summary": "The report indicates that there are several charts where no opinions from the 'no lean' group are provided due to insufficient sample sizes. Specifically, in the chart titled 'Independents' views of U.S.-Mexico border wall, other key issues', the sample size of non-leaning independents was too small for analysis, resulting in no opinions being indicated. Additionally, another chart on the impact of immigrants also noted insufficient data from this group.",

      "raw_result": "The document describes several charts that visualize various aspects of political opinions and behaviors, but specifically regarding the 'no lean' group (independents who do not lean toward either major political party), there are instances where this group's opinions are not represented.\n\n1. **Unfavorable Views of Both Parties**: In a vertical bar chart titled 'Political Ideology Among Independents', the chart showcases stacked segments for different categories of independents, but does not fully present the data for the 'no lean' group. It emphasizes the political polarization, yet lacks detailed opinions specifically from those who are truly independent (reference_id: 1).\n\n2. **Debate over Government Size**: A chart regarding opinions on government size indicates that the sample size for 'no lean' independents was too small for analysis. Consequently, opinions regarding their specifics on this topic remain hidden (reference_id: 1).\n\nThe absence of opinions from the 'no lean' group in these visual representations illustrates a limitation, highlighting that this subgroup's political stance and perspectives could not be adequately captured due to insufficient data.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",

Specifically, one chart on political ideology among independents does not fully present data for the 'no lean' group, and another chart on government size indicates that the sample size for 'no lean' independents was too small for analysis. This highlights a limitation in capturing the perspectives of this subgroup.",
