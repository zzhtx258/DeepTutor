## S1: Analysis of Charts Providing No Opinions from the 'No Lean' Group

In the analysis of the report findings, it has been determined that there are a total of five charts that provide no opinions exclusively from the 'no lean' group. This group consists of independents who do not lean toward either major political party. It is important to note that these charts explicitly indicate that "Don't know" responses are not included in their data presentation.

The topics covered by these charts include:

1. Views on the U.S.-Mexico border wall
2. Unfavorable views of both political parties
3. Political ideology
4. Views on race and gender
5. Trump's job approval rating

This information highlights the specific areas where the 'no lean' group has been analyzed without the influence of uncertain opinions, allowing for a clearer understanding of their perspectives on these critical issues. 

In summary, the report identifies five charts that reflect the opinions of the 'no lean' group, excluding any ambiguous responses.

## S2: Analysis of Reasons for Exclusion of 'No Lean' Group Opinions in Charts

In examining the charts that do not include opinions from the 'no lean' group, it is essential to understand the underlying reasons for this omission. The primary factor identified is insufficient sample sizes, which limits the ability to accurately represent the views of this subgroup of independents who do not lean toward either major political party.

Specifically, the report highlights several instances where the data for the 'no lean' group was inadequate:

1. **Independents' Views on the U.S.-Mexico Border Wall**: The chart titled "Independents' views of U.S.-Mexico border wall, other key issues" reported that the sample size of non-leaning independents was too small for meaningful analysis. Consequently, this resulted in the absence of expressed opinions from this group.

2. **Impact of Immigrants**: Another chart addressing the impact of immigrants also noted insufficient data from the 'no lean' group. The lack of a robust sample size meant that the perspectives of these independents could not be reliably captured.

3. **Political Ideology Among Independents**: In the chart titled "Political Ideology Among Independents," the data representation for the 'no lean' group was incomplete, further illustrating the challenges faced in gathering sufficient responses from this subgroup.

4. **Government Size**: Similarly, the chart discussing government size indicated that the sample size for 'no lean' independents was inadequate, which again led to the exclusion of their opinions.

These limitations underscore the difficulties in capturing a comprehensive view of the 'no lean' group, as the small sample sizes hinder the ability to draw conclusions about their opinions on various political issues. This analysis highlights the importance of ensuring adequate representation in survey data to facilitate a more inclusive understanding of public opinion.

In summary, the absence of opinions from the 'no lean' group in certain charts is primarily due to insufficient sample sizes, which restricts the ability to analyze and present their perspectives effectively.
