## S1: Clarifying the Target Metric and Required Data

The user is asking for the percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2024 election *relative to the entire U.S. population*. This is a conditional proportion: it is not the share of Democrats among voters, nor the voter turnout rate among Democrats, but rather the ratio of *Democratic voters* to the *total population* in 2024. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Democrats who voted in 2024}}{\text{Total U.S. population in 2024}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

To compute this value, two distinct and essential data points are required:
1. The number of registered or identified Democrats who cast a ballot in the 2024 election — this reflects the numerator.
2. The total resident population of the United States in 2024 — this provides the denominator.

As of now, neither of these values has been provided or retrieved. The U.S. population in 2024 is estimated to be approximately 336 million based on U.S. Census Bureau projections, but official voter data by party affiliation from the 2024 election remains preliminary and is not yet fully published by authoritative sources such as the U.S. Election Assistance Commission or Pew Research Center [rag-2]. Therefore, while the conceptual framework is clear, the numerical inputs necessary to compute the requested percentage are not yet available in the current dataset.

In summary, the question is well-defined and statistically meaningful, but its answer cannot be delivered without access to validated, party-specific voter turnout data for 2024 and a confirmed population total. The next step must involve retrieving these two key figures from reliable demographic and electoral datasets.

## S2: Availability of 2024 Election Data — Evidence of Absence and Substitution with 2018 Proxy

The requested metric — the percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2024 election relative to the total U.S. population — cannot be computed due to the absence of finalized, party-specific voter turnout data for the 2024 election. Despite extensive searches across authoritative sources including the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Pew Research Center, and the U.S. Census Bureau, no official or peer-reviewed dataset has been published that reports the number of Democratic voters in the 2024 general election, nor the proportion of self-identified Democrats who participated in voting [rag-1].

The most recent reliable data on party-affiliated voter turnout comes from the 2018 midterm elections, where survey-based estimates from the Current Population Survey (CPS) indicated that **59% of self-identified Democrats reported having voted** [rag-1]. This figure represents the proportion of Democrats *among eligible voters* who cast a ballot — not the proportion of Democrats who voted relative to the total U.S. population. While this 59% rate is not directly applicable to the 2024 context, it remains the closest available empirical anchor for estimating Democratic voter behavior in recent electoral cycles.

It is critical to distinguish between two distinct denominators:
- The **voting-eligible population** (VEP), which includes citizens aged 18+ who are not disenfranchised (e.g., felons in certain states), used in the 59% estimate [rag-1]; and
- The **total U.S. population**, which includes non-citizens, minors, and incarcerated individuals — the denominator required by the user’s question.

Even if we were to assume the 2018 turnout rate of 59% for Democrats applied unchanged to 2024, we would still lack the total number of self-identified Democrats in the 2024 population to compute the numerator. Furthermore, voter behavior tends to shift between midterm and presidential election years, with higher turnout typically observed in presidential cycles like 2024. Thus, using 2018 data as a direct proxy introduces significant estimation bias.

In summary, while the conceptual framework for the desired percentage is well-defined, the absence of validated 2024 party-specific turnout data renders exact computation impossible. The 2018 figure of 59% serves as the best available proxy for Democratic voter participation, but it cannot be meaningfully scaled to the total U.S. population without additional assumptions that would compromise analytical rigor. Until official 2024 data is released, any numerical answer would be speculative and unsupported by evidence.

## S3: Conclusion — The Requested Percentage Cannot Be Computed with Current Data

The question asks for the percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2024 election relative to the total U.S. population. As established in prior steps, this requires two precise inputs: (1) the number of self-identified Democrats who cast a ballot in the 2024 general election, and (2) the total resident population of the United States in 2024 [rag-1]. While the U.S. population in 2024 is reasonably estimated at approximately 336 million based on Census Bureau projections, no official or validated dataset reports the number of Democratic voters in the 2024 election [rag-1]. 

The most recent reliable proxy — 59% of self-identified Democrats reporting voter participation in the 2018 midterm elections — is fundamentally incompatible with the 2024 context. First, 2018 data reflects turnout among the voting-eligible population (VEP), not the total population, and second, midterm and presidential election turnout patterns differ significantly due to heightened political engagement in presidential years [rag-1]. Furthermore, even if we were to assume the 2018 rate applied to 2024, we lack the total number of self-identified Democrats in the 2024 population to compute the numerator. No tool, search, or authoritative source has produced updated party-specific turnout figures for 2024, and no such data has been published by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Pew Research Center, or the Census Bureau as of this analysis.

Therefore, despite the clarity of the conceptual framework — $ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Democratic Voters in 2024}}{\text{Total U.S. Population in 2024}} \right) \times 100\% $ — the necessary empirical inputs remain unavailable. Any attempt to derive a numerical answer would require unsupported assumptions, violating the principle of evidence-based inference. Consequently, with the current available knowledge, it is impossible to compute the requested percentage.

In summary, the question is analytically valid but empirically unanswerable at this time due to the absence of finalized, party-specific voter data for the 2024 election. Until such data is officially released, no credible numerical response can be provided.

    There is no available data on the percentage of Democrats who voted in the 2024 election compared to the entire population. The most recent relevant data is from the 2018 midterm elections, where 59% of self-identified Democrats reported voting.
