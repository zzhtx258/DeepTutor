      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, several charts and tables are derived from **Annual Totals** of Pew Research Center survey data. These annual totals represent aggregated yearly survey results collected by the Pew Research Center, primarily focused on U.S. adults’ political affiliations, demographic characteristics, and views on policy matters.\n\nThe following visualizations and data presentations are explicitly or implicitly sourced from these annual totals:\n\n---\n\n### **Charts Sourced from Annual Totals:**\n\n1. **Pew Research Center Partisan Identification Trends Chart 1994–2018 (image)**  \n   - This stacked area chart visually represents the changing partisan identification of U.S. adults over time, based on annual survey data collected from 1994 to 2018. It shows that while independents grew to 38% by 2018, most lean toward Democrats or Republicans, with only 7% being truly independent.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Annual Totals → Partisan Identification*\n\n2. **Trend in Liberal Identification by Political Affiliation (2000–2018) (image)**  \n   - A line chart displaying the percentage of U.S. adults identifying as liberal over time, segmented by political affiliation groups, using data collected annually between 2000 and 2018.\n   - *Supported by entity: 2000 To 2018; relationship: Line Chart → Pew Research Center*\n\n3. **Partisan Antipathy Trends Among U.S. Adults (1994–2018) (image)**  \n   - A line chart illustrating rising polarization and declining ambivalence in partisan views from 1994 to 2018, based on longitudinal survey data.\n   - *Supported by entity: 1994 To 2018; relationship: Line Chart → Pew Research Center*\n\n4. **Pew Research Center Line Chart on Partisan Favorability Trends 1994–2018 (image)**  \n   - Shows how favorable/unfavorable views of political parties have evolved among U.S. adults over time, reflecting long-term trends captured through annual surveys.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Line Chart → Pew Research Center*\n\n5. **Pew Research Center Presidential Job Approval Ratings by Partisan Group (Clinton to Trump) (image)**  \n   - A multi-panel line chart comparing presidential job approval ratings across partisan groups over time, drawing on repeated annual polling.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Job Approval Rating → Multi-Panel Line Chart*\n\n6. **Pew Research Center Bar Chart on Government Size and Regulation Preferences by Political Affiliation (image)**  \n   - While this chart uses data from specific 2018 survey periods (April-May and September), it reflects broader trends analyzed annually by Pew Research Center on government size and regulation preferences.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Survey Data → Comparative Bar Chart; Annual Totals → Partisan Identification*\n\n7. **Pew Research Center Bar Chart on Public Support for Same-Sex Marriage and Marijuana Legalization by Political Affiliation (image)**  \n   - Displays public opinion trends on social issues, which are tracked annually by Pew Research Center, even if this specific visualization draws from 2017–2018 data.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Survey Data → Comparative Bar Chart*\n\n8. **Pew Research Center Tripartite Bar Chart on Independent Voters' Policy Views (image)**  \n   - Presents comparative policy views of independents, which are part of ongoing annual assessments of political attitudes.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Horizontal Bar Chart → Visual Analysis*\n\n---\n\n### **Tables Sourced from Annual Totals:**\n\n1. **Demographic Profile of Political Affiliation Groups (2018 Pew Data) (table)**  \n   - Breaks down U.S. adults by political affiliation across gender, race, age, and education — a standard demographic analysis conducted annually by Pew Research Center.\n   - *Supported by relationship: Demographic Breakdown → Table Analysis; Annual Totals → Partisan Identification*\n\n---\n\n### **Key Notes:**\n- Although some charts reference specific survey periods (e.g., April–May 2018, September 2018), they often synthesize findings that contribute to longer-term **annual trend analyses**.\n- The **Annual Totals** serve as the foundational dataset for tracking changes over time, especially in partisan identification, ideological self-placement, and policy preferences.\n- All visualizations and tables mentioned above are produced by the **Pew Research Center**, which consistently aggregates and analyzes its survey data on an annual basis to produce comprehensive reports and trend analyses.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
