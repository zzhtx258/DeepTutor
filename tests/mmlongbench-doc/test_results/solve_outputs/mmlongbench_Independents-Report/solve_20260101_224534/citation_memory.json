The data shows that self-reported voting rates were highest among Republicans and Democrats, while independents who did not lean toward either party exhibited the lowest turnout.\n\n- Republicans reported a voter turnout rate of **61%** in the 2018 midterm elections.\n- Democrats reported a slightly lower but still high turnout rate of **59%**.\n- Republican-leaning independents reported a turnout rate of **54%**.\n- Democratic-leaning independents reported a turnout rate of **48%**.\n- Independents who did not lean toward either party had the lowest turnout, with only **33%** reporting that they voted in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThese figures reflect self-reported behavior from a survey conducted between November 7–16, 2018, and highlight a clear pattern: partisan identifiers (Republicans and Democrats) were more likely to vote than independents, with non-lean independents showing the weakest political engagement.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",

The question asks for the percentage of Democrats who voted compared to the entire U.S. population, but the data provided does not include the overall proportion of Democrats in the U.S. population, so that specific comparison cannot be calculated from the given information.",
