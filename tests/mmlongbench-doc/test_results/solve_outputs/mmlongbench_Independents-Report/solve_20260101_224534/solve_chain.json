According to Pew Research Center survey data, **31% of the U.S. adult population identified as Democrats** in that year [rag-2]. This figure represents the baseline demographic share of the population aligned with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe second component is the proportion of those Democrats who actually voted in the 2018 midterm elections. The same source reports that **59% of Democrats self-reported having voted** in the 2018 midterms [rag-1]. This is a conditional rate: it reflects the voting behavior *among* Democrats, not the overall population.\n\nThese two components are distinct but interdependent:  \n- The 31% gives us the size of the Democratic subgroup within the total population.  \n- The 59% tells us the fraction of that subgroup that participated in the election.  \n\nTogether, they form the necessary inputs to compute the joint percentage: the proportion of the *entire U.S. adult population* that consists of Democrats who voted. While the final calculation will be performed in the next step, this step confirms that both required data points are available and grounded in authoritative survey data from Pew Research Center.\n\n### Summary  \nThe two required components are: (1) 31% of the U.S. adult population identified as Democrats in 2018 [rag-2], and (2) 59% of Democrats voted in the 2018 midterm elections [rag-1]. Both values are empirically supported and ready for combination in the next step.",

Specifically, we multiply the proportion of the population that identifies as Democratic by the proportion of that subgroup that voted.\n\nLet $ P_D $ represent the proportion of the U.S. adult population that identified as Democrats in 2018, and $ P_{V|D} $ represent the conditional proportion of Democrats who voted. From the available data:  \n- $ P_D = 0.31 $ (31% of the population) [rag-2],  \n- $ P_{V|D} = 0.59 $ (59% of Democrats voted) [rag-1].\n\nThe joint proportion of the total population that are Democrats who voted is given by:  \n$$\nP_{D \\cap V} = P_D \\times P_{V|D}\n$$  \nSubstituting the values:  \n$$\nP_{D \\cap V} = 0.31 \\times 0.59 = 0.1829\n$$  \nConverting to a percentage:  \n$$\n0.1829 \\times 100\\% = 18.29\\%\n$$  \n\nThis result, confirmed by code execution, indicates that **18.29% of the entire U.S. adult population in 2018 were individuals who both identified as Democrats and reported voting in the midterm elections** [code-1]. This is not a turnout rate among Democrats (which is 59%), nor is it the share of Democrats in the population (31%); rather, it is the *intersection* of these two groups relative to the whole population — a key distinction in demographic analysis.\n\n### Summary  \nThe calculation confirms that 18.29% of the total U.S. adult population in 2018 consisted of Democrats who voted, derived from multiplying 31% by 59%, as supported by Pew Research Center data and verified through direct computation.",
