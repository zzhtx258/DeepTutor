## Concise Answer

None of the presidents can be determined to have had a 5% increase in Democratic support rate due to insufficient data.

## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identify the Key Requirement and Assess Data Availability

To determine which of Clinton, G.W. Bush, or Obama experienced a 5% increase in Democratic support rate from their first to last year of presidency, we must evaluate the **Democratic job approval rating**—the standard metric for measuring partisan support for U.S. presidents, as defined by public opinion surveys conducted by organizations such as the Pew Research Center [rag-3]. This metric isolates the proportion of individuals who identify as Democrats (or lean Democratic) who approve of the president’s job performance in specific years of their term.

The objective requires comparing two data points for each president:
- Democratic approval rating in the **first year** of presidency
- Democratic approval rating in the **last year** of presidency  
Then calculating the difference to identify whether any president met the threshold of a **+5% increase**.

However, upon querying the available materials for the exact Democratic approval ratings for each president during these critical years, the results consistently indicate **insufficient data**:

- For **Bill Clinton**: No Democratic approval ratings are available for 1993 (first year) or 2000 (last year). While a figure of ~42% approval among *independents* during his first two years is mentioned, this does not reflect Democratic voters [rag-4][rag-5].
- For **George W. Bush**: No data exists for Democratic approval in 2001 (first year) or 2008 (last year). The source material references overall or independent approval trends but lacks partisan breakdowns for Democrats [rag-6].
- For **Barack Obama**: No Democratic-specific approval ratings are provided for 2009 (first year) or 2016 (last year). Although approval among independents is noted (50% in 2009, 42% in 2010), these figures are not applicable to the Democratic subgroup [rag-7].

Thus, despite clearly defining the required metric and target comparison, **none of the necessary data points**—Democratic approval ratings in the first and last years for any of the three presidents—are present in the provided materials.

### Summary  
The requirement to identify a 5% increase in Democratic support rate from first to last year of presidency cannot be answered with the current data, as the partisan-specific approval ratings for Clinton (1993/2000), G.W. Bush (2001/2008), and Obama (2009/2016) are entirely absent from the available sources. Further data collection from authoritative polling archives (e.g., Pew Research Center, Gallup) would be necessary to proceed.

## S2: Evaluate Data Availability for Democratic Support Rate Changes

To determine whether any of the three presidents—Clinton, G.W. Bush, or Obama—experienced a 5% increase in Democratic support rate from their first to last year in office, we must assess the availability of **partisan-specific job approval data** for these exact time points. As established in S1, the metric of interest is the proportion of self-identified Democrats (including Democratic leaners) who approve of the president’s job performance, a standard measure tracked by reputable polling institutions such as Pew Research Center and Gallup [rag-3].

The analysis now focuses on whether the available materials contain the necessary data pairs:  
- **First-year Democratic approval** (1993 for Clinton, 2001 for G.W. Bush, 2009 for Obama)  
- **Last-year Democratic approval** (2000 for Clinton, 2008 for G.W. Bush, 2016 for Obama)

Upon systematic review of the provided knowledge base citations and tool execution results:

- **[rag-1]** explicitly states: *“The provided context does not contain specific data on Bill Clinton's Democratic support rate during his first year of presidency,”* and further confirms that *“no information is available for George W. Bush or Barack Obama to compare changes over their presidencies.”* This directly negates the possibility of computing a year-over-year change for any of the three.
  
- **[rag-2]** reinforces this conclusion by asserting: *“The available data does not provide Democratic support rates for... [all three] in their final years of presidency,”* and concludes that *“it is not possible to determine which, if any, experienced a 5% increase.”*

The tool execution result corroborates these findings, returning a summary identical to the knowledge base: *“Insufficient data exists on Democratic support rates for Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama in their first and last years of presidency...”* [none].

Notably, while some materials reference approval ratings among *independents* (e.g., Clinton’s ~42% average among independents during his early years [rag-1]), these figures are **not interchangeable** with Democratic-specific support. Partisan approval ratings are distinct from general or independent approval, as Democrats are more likely to express high approval for co-partisan presidents, making cross-group comparisons invalid for this analysis [rag-3].

No tables, charts, or supplementary datasets were generated or provided to fill this gap. No image artifacts are available for integration.

Thus, despite the clarity of the analytical objective, **the foundational data required to compute any year-over-year change in Democratic support is entirely absent** across all sources.

### Summary  
The evaluation of available knowledge confirms that no reliable, partisan-specific Democratic approval ratings exist for the first or last years of Clinton, G.W. Bush, or Obama’s presidencies. Without these data points, it is mathematically and empirically impossible to determine whether any president met the 5% threshold. The knowledge chain is incomplete at its most critical juncture.

## S3: Conclusion — The Question Cannot Be Answered with Available Data

The analytical objective—to identify whether Clinton, G.W. Bush, or Obama experienced a 5% increase in Democratic support rate from their first to last year in office—requires precise, partisan-specific approval ratings for well-defined time points: 1993 and 2000 for Clinton, 2001 and 2008 for G.W. Bush, and 2009 and 2016 for Obama. However, as explicitly stated in both knowledge base sources, **no such data exists**.

[rag-1] directly asserts: *“The provided context does not contain specific data on Bill Clinton's Democratic support rate during his first year of presidency, and no information is available for George W. Bush or Barack Obama to compare changes over their presidencies.”* Similarly, [rag-2] confirms: *“The available data does not provide Democratic support rates for Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, or Barack Obama in their final years of presidency, so it is not possible to determine which, if any, experienced a 5% increase in support from their first to last year.”* These statements are not ambiguous—they are definitive in their negation of data availability.

The tool execution result corroborates this conclusion verbatim, reiterating that *“no data is available to compute the Democratic support rate change”* for any of the three presidents across the required time frames. Importantly, alternative metrics—such as approval ratings among independents or overall public approval—are not substitutes for Democratic-specific support, as partisan loyalty significantly skews approval patterns, rendering cross-group comparisons invalid for this analysis [rag-3].

Without the foundational data points—the Democratic approval ratings in the first and last years of each president’s term—it is mathematically impossible to compute a change, let alone determine whether it met or exceeded a 5% threshold. No charts, tables, or supplementary datasets were generated or provided to bridge this gap.

### Summary  
Given the explicit and consistent absence of Democratic-specific approval ratings for all three presidents at the required time points, the question cannot be answered with the information currently available. Any conclusion asserting a 5% increase would be speculative and unsupported by evidence.

    The standard metric for measuring a U.S. president’s support rate among Democrats is the job approval rating, derived from partisan-segmented public opinion surveys by organizations like Pew Research Center. For example, Donald Trump’s approval among Democrats was 7–9% during 2017–2018, while Barack Obama’s was 65% among Democratic-leaning independents (2009–2010).
