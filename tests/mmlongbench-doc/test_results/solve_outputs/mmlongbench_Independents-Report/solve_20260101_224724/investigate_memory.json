      "raw_result": "The provided context does not contain sufficient information to determine the change in Democratic support rates from the first year to the last year of the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. While the document discusses job approval ratings for Donald Trump during his first two years in office and provides comparative data for Obama, Bush, and Clinton during their first years, it does not include approval ratings for these presidents in their final years in office. Specifically, the data for Obama’s second year (2010) is mentioned, but no data is provided for his final year (2016); similarly, no data is given for the final years of Clinton (2000) or Bush (2008). Therefore, the requested change in support rates over the full presidencies cannot be calculated from the available information.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
