      "raw_result": "The standard metric used to measure a U.S. president's support rate among Democrats during their term in office is **job approval rating**, as assessed through public opinion surveys conducted by organizations such as the Pew Research Center. These ratings are typically derived from survey data asking respondents whether they approve or disapprove of the president’s job performance, with responses segmented by political affiliation, including those who identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party.\n\nFor example, during Donald Trump’s first two years in office, his job approval rating among Democrats was reported at 7% in 2017 and 9% in 2018. Similarly, Barack Obama’s approval among Democrats was measured at 65% among Democratic-leaning independents during his first two years (2009–2010), reflecting the same metric applied across partisan groups.\n\nThis metric is consistently used to evaluate presidential performance within specific partisan groups and is often compared across administrations to analyze levels of partisan polarization.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
