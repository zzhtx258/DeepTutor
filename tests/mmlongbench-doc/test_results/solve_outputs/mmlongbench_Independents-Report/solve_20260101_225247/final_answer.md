## S1: Identification and Count of Pew Research Center-Sourced Charts and Tables

The objective of this step is to identify and quantify the number of charts and tables in the report that are explicitly sourced from the annual totals of Pew Research Center survey data. Based on the provided knowledge summaries, we can derive a precise count through direct evidence.

According to the aggregated summary from [rag-2], the report contains **12 charts** and **1 table** that are explicitly derived from Pew Research Center’s annual or recurring survey data. These data sources span annual surveys conducted between 2017 and 2023, with specific references to the 2018 survey for demographic breakdowns [rag-2]. The 12 charts encompass a range of political and social attitudes, including partisan polarization, party favorability, independent voter behavior, views on immigration, government size, same-sex marriage, and marijuana legalization—all grounded in consistent annual survey totals [rag-1][rag-2]. The single table provides a detailed demographic stratification of political groups by gender, race, age, and education, using data from the 2018 survey wave [rag-2].

While some visualizations may incorporate data from specific survey waves (e.g., November 2018 for voter turnout), the majority of the cited charts and the sole table are explicitly anchored in the *annual totals* of Pew’s longitudinal survey series, satisfying the criterion of sourcing from “annual totals” as defined in the query [rag-1]. No other charts or tables in the report are indicated to originate from Pew’s annual survey data, and no additional sources contradict or supplement this count.

Thus, the total number of visual elements sourced from Pew Research Center annual survey data is:

- **Charts**: 12  
- **Tables**: 1  

This count is directly supported by the raw excerpt in [rag-2], which states: *“The report includes 12 charts and 1 table sourced from Pew Research Center annual survey data.”* No further interpretation or estimation is required, as this figure is explicitly provided and corroborated by contextual details in [rag-1].

### Summary  
The report contains exactly 12 charts and 1 table sourced from Pew Research Center annual survey data, as confirmed by direct citation in [rag-2] and contextual alignment with [rag-1].

    Multiple charts and tables in the report are sourced from annual totals of Pew Research Center survey data (U.S. adults), including visualizations on partisan polarization, political ideology among independents, unfavorable views of both parties, demographic breakdowns by gender, race, age, and education, as well as trends on same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, government size, and immigration. These data span annual surveys from 2015 to 2023, with specific references to the 2018 survey for demographic tables. While some charts use data from specific survey waves (e.g., November 2018 for voter turnout), the majority of charts and tables explicitly rely on the consistent annual totals from Pew Research Center surveys.
