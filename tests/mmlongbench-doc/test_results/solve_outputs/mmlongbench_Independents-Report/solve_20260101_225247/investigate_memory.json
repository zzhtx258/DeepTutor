      "raw_result": "The Pew Research Center’s annual survey data serves as the primary source for multiple charts and tables presented in the report, providing comprehensive insights into American political attitudes, partisan identification, and demographic trends among independents. These data are derived from annual surveys of U.S. adults conducted between 2015 and 2023, with specific datasets cited for individual visualizations. For example, the vertical bar chart titled “Most Americans feel favorably toward one party, unfavorably toward the other” uses annual totals from Pew Research Center survey data (U.S. adults), showing a rise in partisan polarization from 58% in 2015 to 66% in recent years. Similarly, the stacked bar chart on political ideology among independents and the vertical bar chart on unfavorable views of both parties rely on annual totals from the same data source, tracking changes over time.\n\nDemographic breakdowns, such as those presented in the table comparing gender, race, age, and education across political groups (Republican, Democrat, Independent, Lean Republican, Lean Democrat, No Lean), are explicitly sourced from the “Annual total of 2018 Pew Research Center survey data (U.S. adults).” Other visualizations, including those on same-sex marriage support, marijuana legalization, views on government size, and immigration, also reference Pew’s annual surveys or specific survey waves conducted in 2017–2018. The consistent use of “Annual totals of Pew Research Center survey data (U.S. adults)” across multiple charts confirms the longitudinal and nationally representative nature of the data underpinning the report’s findings. Additionally, footnotes in several charts note that “Don’t know” responses are excluded, ensuring the data reflect only clear partisan attitudes.\n\nThe report also includes specialized survey data from specific timeframes—for instance, the horizontal bar chart on voter registration and turnout in the 2018 midterms draws from a survey conducted November 7–16, 2018, via the online American Trends Panel. While some charts reference smaller sample sizes (e.g., N=93 for non-lean independents on government size), all data are explicitly attributed to Pew Research Center’s own public opinion polling, demographic research, and content analysis methodologies, reinforcing the credibility and consistency of the source across all visual and tabular representations.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
      "summary": "Multiple charts and tables in the report are sourced from annual totals of Pew Research Center survey data (U.S. adults), including visualizations on partisan polarization, political ideology among independents, unfavorable views of both parties, demographic breakdowns by gender, race, age, and education, as well as trends on same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, government size, and immigration. These data span annual surveys from 2015 to 2023, with specific references to the 2018 survey for demographic tables. While some charts use data from specific survey waves (e.g., November 2018 for voter turnout), the majority of charts and tables explicitly rely on the consistent annual totals from Pew Research Center surveys.",
