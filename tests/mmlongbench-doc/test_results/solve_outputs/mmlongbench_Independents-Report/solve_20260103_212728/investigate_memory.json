      "raw_result": "In examining the job approval ratings among Democrats for Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, we can summarize the findings as follows:\n\n### Job Approval Ratings for Democrats\n\n**Bill Clinton**  \n- **First Year:** Clinton's job approval among Democrats averaged **52%**.\n- **Last Year:** His job approval among Democrats was approximately **60%**.\n\n**George W. Bush**  \n- **First Year:** In his initial year, Bush maintained a job approval rating of around **88%** among Democrats.\n- **Last Year:** By the end of his presidency, his approval rating among Democrats dropped to **12%**.\n\n**Barack Obama**  \n- **First Year:** Obama's job approval among Democrats started at around **65%**.\n- **Last Year:** In his final year, this rating fell to approximately **40%**.\n\nThis polarized trajectory demonstrates how approval ratings among Democrats shifted throughout the presidencies of each individual. \n\n### References\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
      "summary": "Among the three presidents, Bill Clinton's support rate by Democrats increased by 8% in his last year of presidency, from 52% in his first year to 60% in his last year. In contrast, George W. Bush's support dropped significantly from 88% to 12%, and Barack Obama's support decreased from 65% to 40%. Therefore, Clinton is the only one whose support rate increased by more than 5%.",

      "raw_result": "In examining the job approval ratings of Presidents Clinton, George W.

Bush.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Independents-Report.pdf",
      "summary": "Among Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama, none of their approval ratings by Democrats increased by 5% in their last year compared to their first year.
