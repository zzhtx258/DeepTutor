Bush, and Barack Obama, we can derive significant insights based on the provided data.\n\n### Support Rate Overview\n\n1. **Bill Clinton**:\n   - **First Year Support**: 52%\n   - **Last Year Support**: 60%\n   - **Change**: An increase of 8%\n\n2. **George W. Bush**:\n   - **First Year Support**: 88%\n   - **Last Year Support**: 12%\n   - **Change**: A decrease of 76%\n\n3. **Barack Obama**:\n   - **First Year Support**: 65%\n   - **Last Year Support**: 40%\n   - **Change**: A decrease of 25%\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that among the three presidents, only Bill Clinton experienced an increase in support rate by Democrats, rising by 8% from his first year to his last year in office. In contrast, both George W. Bush and Barack Obama saw significant declines in their support rates, with Bush's support plummeting by 76% and Obama's by 25%. Therefore, Bill Clinton is the only president in this comparison whose support rate increased by more than 5% during his presidency.",
