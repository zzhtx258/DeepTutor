While all steps are essential to the pipeline’s integrity, a qualitative comparison of their descriptive elaboration reveals that **Evolutionary Question Generation** is described with significantly greater depth and technical specificity than the other two.\n\nThis step involves not only the generation of questions but also an iterative refinement mechanism powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It employs a composite scoring function, denoted as $Score_r$, which balances two key dimensions: *informativeness* and *readability* [rag-1]. The process may undergo up to five iterations to optimize question quality, culminating in the production of a **Minimum Knowledge Set** intended for downstream evaluation purposes. Furthermore, this phase references supplementary materials — specifically Appendix E — indicating additional algorithmic or implementation details beyond the main text [rag-1].\n\nIn contrast, the descriptions of **Person Selection** and **Name Disambiguation** are comparatively concise, lacking explicit mention of scoring functions, iteration counts, or cross-references to appendices. This suggests that while these steps are foundational, they are presented at a higher level of abstraction without the same degree of procedural or evaluative granularity.\n\nThus, based on the available documentation, **Evolutionary Question Generation** stands out as the most thoroughly described step in the dataset construction pipeline, both in terms of conceptual scope and technical exposition.\n\n### Summary\nThe Evolutionary Question Generation step is the most verbose and technically detailed among the three stages of the BioKaLMA dataset construction pipeline, featuring algorithmic components, scoring metrics, iteration limits, and external references — making it the step that takes the most words to describe.",
