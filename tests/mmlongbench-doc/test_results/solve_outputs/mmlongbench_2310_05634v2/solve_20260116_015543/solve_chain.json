These tables are:\n\n- **Table 3**: Evaluates citation quality across eight large language models (LLMs) using micro F1-score and macro F1-score, alongside precision, recall, and alignment scores. This table is titled “Citation Quality Evaluation…” [rag-1].\n- **Table 5**: Reports F1-Score performance under varying conditions of knowledge removal in a knowledge graph evaluation framework [rag-1].\n- **Table 7**: Compares F1 Score performance between general and specific questions for two models — GPT-4 and ChatGPT — highlighting differences in model behavior based on question type [rag-1].\n\nThese tables collectively demonstrate the use of F1-score as a key evaluation metric in assessing model performance across different tasks: citation quality, knowledge graph robustness, and question-specific response accuracy.\n\nThe count of **3** is directly supported by both the textual summary from the RAG query and the raw numerical result returned by the tool execution [rag-1][tool-raw: 3].\n\n### Summary\nThree distinct tables — Table 3, Table 5, and Table 7 — explicitly include “F1” as a performance metric, confirming the total count as 3.",
