It is specifically titled \"Citation Quality Evaluation Across LLMs (Table 3) (table)\" and explicitly includes F1-Score as one of the evaluated metrics.\n\n- **Table 7**: This table compares performance metrics between general and specific questions for text, citation, and alignment. It includes F1 Score as one of the metrics under citation evaluation, showing comparative results for GPT-4 and ChatGPT across different question settings.\n\n- **Table 5**: This table evaluates citation quality using a knowledge graph with varying amounts of knowledge removed. It reports metrics such as correctness, precision, recall, and F1-Score, making it relevant to F1-based analysis under knowledge removal conditions.\n\nThese tables are central to evaluating model performance through the F1 metric, either at micro/macro levels or under specific experimental conditions like knowledge removal or question specificity.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Citation Quality Evaluation Across LLMs (Table 3) (table)\n- [2] Table 7: Comparison of Evaluation Results on General and Specific Question Settings (table)\n- [3] Table 5: Citation Quality Under Knowledge Removal (table)",
