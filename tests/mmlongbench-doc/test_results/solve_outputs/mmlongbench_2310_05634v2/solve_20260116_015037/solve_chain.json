This marker serves as a semantic indicator of a knowledge gap — meaning that for certain generated statements or relational paths, no corresponding entity or triplet from the underlying Knowledge Graph can be identified or attributed. Consequently, these arrows terminate at the `[NA]` token rather than connecting to concrete, grounded entities or leaf nodes.\n\nThis design choice reflects an intentional mechanism to surface incompleteness or uncertainty in the knowledge base. Instead of forcing a connection to an incorrect or speculative node, the system opts to flag the absence of valid grounding by directing the arrow to `[NA]`. This is particularly useful in evaluation or diagnostic contexts where identifying missing knowledge is as important as verifying correct associations.\n\n### Summary\nThe only relation arrows in Figure 1 that do not point to specific leaf nodes are those terminating at the `[NA]` marker, which signals a lack of attributable knowledge in the graph for those particular relations [rag-5].",
