## Detailed Answer

## S1: Analysis of Line Color and Intersection Properties in Figure 5

Based on a comprehensive review of all available materials — including six distinct RAG queries targeting the specific question, tool execution results, and absence of any visual artifacts — it is confirmed that **no information exists** regarding the color or intersection behavior of lines in **Figure 5**.

The context consistently describes Figure 5 as a line chart illustrating the degradation of citation metrics (precision, recall, F1-Score, correctness) as retrieval accuracy decreases [rag-1][rag-2]. While trends such as “recall is most impacted” and “correctness is most resilient” are noted, **no mention is made of line colors, markers, or geometric intersections between lines** [rag-3][rag-4].

Furthermore, although Figure 4 is referenced with explicit color and marker details (e.g., “blue circles for precision”), such specifications are **not extended to Figure 5** [rag-2]. No code output, image artifact, or supplementary document provides visual or textual evidence to infer which line—if any—does not intersect with others, nor what its color might be.

Therefore, based strictly on the principle of evidence-based reasoning and after exhausting all available sources:

> The color of the line in Figure 5 that has no intersection with any other line **cannot be determined** from the provided materials. This question is **Not answerable** under current constraints.

This conclusion aligns with the core principle that answers must be grounded exclusively in available data — and in this case, the required data simply does not exist within the corpus.

    No relevant information found for this query. The question may be Not answerable based on available documents. The context describes Figure 5 as showing downward trends in citation metrics (precision, recall, F1-Score, correctness) with decreasing retrieval accuracy, and notes that recall is most impacted while correctness is most resilient. However, no details about line colors or intersections are provided for Figure 5. Color and marker details are given for Figure 4, but not for Figure 5.
