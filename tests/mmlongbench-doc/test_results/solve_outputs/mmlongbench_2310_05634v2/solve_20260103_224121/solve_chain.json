Each table serves a distinct purpose in evaluating various aspects of model performance and citation quality. Below is a detailed description of these tables:\n\n1. **Table 3: Citation Quality of OpenAI Models and LLaMA Family Models**\n   - This table evaluates citation quality metrics, specifically focusing on Micro and Macro F1 scores across different models. It highlights the performance differences between OpenAI models and LLaMA models in terms of citation accuracy.\n\n2. **Table 4: F1 Score Evaluation in Text Quality Assessment**\n   - This table discusses the relevance of F1 scores in assessing the overall quality of generated text, linking these scores to citation precision and recall metrics.\n\n3. **Table 5: Impact of Knowledge Removal from Knowledge Graphs on F1 Scores**\n   - This table examines how the removal of knowledge from a knowledge graph influences F1 scores, providing insights into the effects of knowledge availability on citation quality metrics.\n\n4. **Table 7: Comparison of Model Performance on General vs. Specific Questions**\n   - This table compares F1 scores in the context of answering general versus specific questions, emphasizing how model performance varies based on the type of inquiry.\n\nThese tables collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how F1 scores are utilized in evaluating model performance and citation quality across different contexts.",
