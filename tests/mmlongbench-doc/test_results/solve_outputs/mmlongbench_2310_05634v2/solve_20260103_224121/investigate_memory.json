      "raw_result": "Certainly! In the provided context, several tables utilize 'F1' as a metric, particularly in the evaluation of language model performance. Below is a summary of those tables:\n\n### Tables Including 'F1' as a Metric\n\n1. **Table 3: Citation Quality OpenAI models and LLaMA family models**\n   - This table presents the citation quality metrics, including F1 scores across various language models. The table shows both micro and macro F1 scores, revealing performance differences among models. It emphasizes how OpenAI models, particularly GPT-4, achieve higher F1 scores than their LLaMA counterparts.\n\n2. **Table 5: Citation quality evaluation for generated texts using a KG with N pieces of knowledge removed**\n   - This table evaluates the impact of removing knowledge from a knowledge graph on citation quality metrics, including F1 scores. It demonstrates that as more knowledge is removed, the F1 score drastically declines, indicating that both precision and recall are affected.\n\n3. **Table 4: Evaluation on generated text quality**\n   - Although this table primarily focuses on text quality, it presents F1 scores related to citation precision and recall metrics, linking them to the language models' performance in generating coherent and relevant text.\n\n4. **Table 7: Comparison of evaluation results on General and Specific question setting**\n   - This table compares F1 scores in the context of general and specific questions, highlighting how different question formats influence the models' performance, including in terms of F1 metrics.\n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
      "summary": "There are four tables that include 'F1' as a metric, specifically in the evaluation of language model performance. Notably, Table 3 presents F1 scores across various language models, highlighting that OpenAI models achieve higher scores than LLaMA models. Table 5 evaluates how the removal of knowledge from a knowledge graph affects F1 scores, while Table 4 links F1 scores to citation precision and recall in generated text quality. Lastly, Table 7 compares F1 scores in general versus specific question settings.",
