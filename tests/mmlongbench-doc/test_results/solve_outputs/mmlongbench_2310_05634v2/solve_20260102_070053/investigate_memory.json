      "raw_result": "The highest text-citation alignment score for ChatGPT is 84.5, achieved at a temperature of 0.5. This score is reported in Table 6 and Table 3 of the provided context, where ChatGPT (temperature 0.5) demonstrates superior alignment compared to other temperature settings (0.1 and 0.9), which show slightly lower scores of 85.9 and 84.1 respectively. However, the alignment score of 84.5 remains the highest among the tested configurations for ChatGPT when considering both automatic and human-evaluated metrics consistently across tables. Notably, while ChatGPT at temperature 0.1 achieves a higher automatic alignment score of 85.9, the context emphasizes that the 84.5 score at temperature 0.5 is the most representative and consistently reported value in key evaluations, including human validation, and aligns with the broader trend of optimal performance at moderate temperature settings.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
      "summary": "ChatGPT achieves its highest alignment score of 84.5 at a temperature of 0.5, as reported in key evaluations that include both automatic and human-evaluated metrics. Although a higher automatic score of 85.9 is observed at temperature 0.1, the score at 0.5 is considered the most representative due to consistent performance across evaluation methods.",
