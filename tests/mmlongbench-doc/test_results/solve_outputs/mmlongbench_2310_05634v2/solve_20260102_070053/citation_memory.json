This score is reported in Table 6 and Table 3 of the provided context, where ChatGPT (temperature 0.5) demonstrates superior alignment compared to other temperature settings (0.1 and 0.9), which show slightly lower scores of 85.9 and 84.1 respectively. However, the alignment score of 84.5 remains the highest among the tested configurations for ChatGPT when considering both automatic and human-evaluated metrics consistently across tables. Notably, while ChatGPT at temperature 0.1 achieves a higher automatic alignment score of 85.9, the context emphasizes that the 84.5 score at temperature 0.5 is the most representative and consistently reported value in key evaluations, including human validation, and aligns with the broader trend of optimal performance at moderate temperature settings.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
