      "step_response": "## S1: Identify Tables Containing 'F1' as a Metric\n\nThe F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in scenarios with class imbalance [rag-1]. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to generate accurate, cited responses, the F1-Score serves as a key metric for assessing text-citation alignment and factual recall quality [rag-1].\n\nBased on the provided knowledge, three distinct tables explicitly include the F1-Score (or its variants) as a reported evaluation metric:\n\n1. **Table 3**: Reports the F1-Score using both micro-averaged and macro-averaged calculations across multiple LLMs, enabling a comprehensive comparison of model performance under standardized citation tasks [rag-1].\n2. **Table 5**: Evaluates the F1-Score under varying degrees of knowledge removal, illustrating how the degradation of underlying knowledge graphs impacts the model’s ability to maintain citation accuracy [rag-1].\n3. **Table 7**: Compares F1-Score results between two distinct question types—General and Specific—highlighting how question granularity influences the model’s citation fidelity [rag-1].\n\nThese tables collectively demonstrate that the F1-Score is a central and consistently applied metric in evaluating citation quality within LLM research, capturing both recall and precision dimensions of generated citations.\n\nIn summary, exactly three tables—Table 3, Table 5, and Table 7—include 'F1' as a metric, as explicitly stated in the available knowledge source [rag-1].",
