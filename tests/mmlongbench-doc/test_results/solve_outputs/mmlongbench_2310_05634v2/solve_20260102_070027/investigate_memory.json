      "raw_result": "The provided context includes multiple tables that report the F1-Score (F1.) metric as part of the evaluation of citation quality and text-citation alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). These tables assess model performance under varying conditions such as knowledge graph completeness, model architecture, and retrieval accuracy.\n\nOne key table is **Table 3**, which presents citation quality metrics across multiple LLMs, including F1-Score calculated in both micro and macro formats. For example:\n- GPT-4 (0.5) achieves a micro F1-Score of 39.4.\n- ChatGPT (0.5) achieves a micro F1-Score of 37.2 and a macro F1-Score of 40.4.\n- LLaMA-7B has a micro F1-Score of 13.0 and a macro F1-Score of 17.4.\n- Vicuna-13B shows a micro F1-Score of 15.8 and a macro F1-Score of 16.0.\n\nAnother relevant table is **Table 5**, which evaluates the impact of progressively removing knowledge from the knowledge graph on citation quality. The F1-Score declines sharply as knowledge is removed:\n- With 0 (gold) knowledge removed, the F1-Score is 39.4.\n- After removing 3 pieces of knowledge, the F1-Score drops to 18.1.\n\nAdditionally, **Table 7** compares F1-Scores between General and Specific question settings:\n- For GPT-4 (0.5), the micro F1-Score increases from 35.6 (General) to 39.4 (Specific).\n- For ChatGPT (0.5), it increases from 32.9 (General) to 37.2 (Specific).\n\n**Figure 5** also visually depicts the F1-Score trend under decreasing retrieval accuracy (from 100% to 20%), showing a drop from approximately 53 at 100% accuracy to about 25 at 20% accuracy, reinforcing the sensitivity of F1-Score to retrieval quality.\n\nThese tables collectively demonstrate that F1-Score is a central metric for evaluating citation reliability and is highly sensitive to both knowledge coverage and retrieval performance.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
      "summary": "Three tables include 'F1' as a metric: Table 3 reports F1-Score (micro and macro) across multiple LLMs; Table 5 evaluates F1-Score under varying levels of knowledge removal; and Table 7 compares F1-Score between General and Specific question settings. These tables collectively show that F1-Score is a key metric for assessing citation quality in Large Language Models.",
