## S1: Identify Tables Containing 'F1' as a Metric

The F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in scenarios with class imbalance [rag-1]. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to generate accurate, cited responses, the F1-Score serves as a key metric for assessing text-citation alignment and factual recall quality [rag-1].

Based on the provided knowledge, three distinct tables explicitly include the F1-Score (or its variants) as a reported evaluation metric:

1. **Table 3**: Reports the F1-Score using both micro-averaged and macro-averaged calculations across multiple LLMs, enabling a comprehensive comparison of model performance under standardized citation tasks [rag-1].
2. **Table 5**: Evaluates the F1-Score under varying degrees of knowledge removal, illustrating how the degradation of underlying knowledge graphs impacts the model’s ability to maintain citation accuracy [rag-1].
3. **Table 7**: Compares F1-Score results between two distinct question types—General and Specific—highlighting how question granularity influences the model’s citation fidelity [rag-1].

These tables collectively demonstrate that the F1-Score is a central and consistently applied metric in evaluating citation quality within LLM research, capturing both recall and precision dimensions of generated citations.

In summary, exactly three tables—Table 3, Table 5, and Table 7—include 'F1' as a metric, as explicitly stated in the available knowledge source [rag-1].

    Three tables include 'F1' as a metric: Table 3 reports F1-Score (micro and macro) across multiple LLMs; Table 5 evaluates F1-Score under varying levels of knowledge removal; and Table 7 compares F1-Score between General and Specific question settings. These tables collectively show that F1-Score is a key metric for assessing citation quality in Large Language Models.
