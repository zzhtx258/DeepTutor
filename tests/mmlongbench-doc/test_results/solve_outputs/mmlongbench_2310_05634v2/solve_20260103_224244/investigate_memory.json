This score indicates a solid ability in providing accurate citations that support the generated text, reflecting the model's superior grounding capabilities compared to others in the evaluation (such as the LLaMA-7B and Vicuna-13B models) [1]. \n\nAdditionally, the performance of ChatGPT indicates that models with higher parameter counts, such as ChatGPT (175 billion parameters), are crucial in achieving alignment scores above 80, thereby underscoring the importance of model size in citation quality.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
