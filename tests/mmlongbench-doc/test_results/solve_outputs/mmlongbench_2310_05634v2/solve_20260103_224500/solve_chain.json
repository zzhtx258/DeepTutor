In the context of language models, particularly within the Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) framework, this concept is crucial as it describes the model's ability to identify when it lacks necessary knowledge from its knowledge graph. \n\nA sentence may be marked as '[NA]' (Not Applicable Citation) when the model detects a gap in the required knowledge, indicating that the assertion made cannot be substantiated. This marking is essential for evaluating the model's performance and ensuring the reliability of its outputs. The model's recognition of its limitations is a key aspect of conscious incompetence, as it allows for transparency regarding the knowledge it can or cannot provide.\n\nInterestingly, a sentence can also map to both '[NA]' and specific sub-graph knowledge. This occurs when some information within the sentence is partially verifiable. For instance, if a sentence contains elements that the model can access and validate, it can still acknowledge the absence of complete knowledge by marking it as '[NA]'. This dual mapping enhances the model's reliability by allowing it to utilize relevant data while simultaneously indicating its knowledge limitations. \n\nIn summary, conscious incompetence in language models not only highlights the model's awareness of its knowledge gaps but also facilitates a nuanced approach to sentence mapping, where partial verifiability can coexist with the acknowledgment of absent knowledge. This mechanism is vital for improving the overall trustworthiness and effectiveness of language models in processing and generating information.",

This dual mapping is significant as it reflects the model's recognition of its knowledge limitations while still utilizing available information.\n\n### Conditions for Dual Mapping\n\n1. **Partially Verifiable Information**: A sentence may contain elements that can be partially verified against the knowledge graph. This means that while some aspects of the sentence are supported by existing knowledge, others may not be fully substantiated, leading to the need for an '[NA]' designation.\n\n2. **Absence of Complete Supporting Knowledge**: The sentence might express a claim that requires additional knowledge that is not present in the knowledge graph. This absence necessitates marking the sentence as '[NA]', indicating that while some information is available, it does not provide a complete picture.\n\n3. **Identification of Uncertain Claims**: When a sentence includes claims that are uncertain or ambiguous, it can lead to a dual mapping. The model acknowledges these uncertainties by designating the sentence as '[NA]', while still referencing any relevant sub-graph knowledge that may apply.\n\n4. **Need for Supporting Knowledge**: If the sentence refers to multiple pieces of knowledge, but some of these are missing or require further verification, the model can still utilize the available information while marking the sentence as '[NA]'. This highlights the model's transparency regarding its limitations.\n\n5. **Contextual Cues Indicating Uncertainty**: Sentences that include contextual hints suggesting uncertainty about the information can also map to both '[NA]' and sub-graph knowledge. This allows the model to communicate its limitations effectively while still engaging with the relevant data.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, a sentence can map to both '[NA]' and sub-graph knowledge when it contains partially verifiable information, lacks complete supporting knowledge, identifies uncertain claims, requires additional supporting knowledge, or includes contextual cues of uncertainty. This dual mapping enhances the model's reliability and transparency, allowing it to acknowledge knowledge gaps while still leveraging available information.",

          "raw_answer": "**Conscious Incompetence in Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution**\n\nIn the context of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), \"Conscious Incompetence\" relates to the model's ability to identify the need for supporting knowledge that is absent from the knowledge graph (KG). The term is derived from psychological concepts where an individual recognizes their own lack of knowledge in a particular area.\n\n### Definitions:\n- **Conscious Incompetence**: This is a state where a language model acknowledges the presence of a knowledge gap. It recognizes that certain supporting information needed to formulate a comprehensive answer is missing from the retrieved KG.\n  \n### Conditions for Indicating [NA] and Relevant Sub-graph Knowledge:\n- A generated sentence can be associated with the Not Applicable Citation ([NA]) if it requires certain knowledge for verification that is not found in the knowledge graph.\n- A sentence may also map to relevant sub-graph knowledge from the KG if it can be partially verified. This happens when:\n  - The sentence explicitly references knowledge that is indeed present in the KG.\n  - In addition, the sentence expresses a need for knowledge that is absent, which would prompt the marking of that part as [NA].\n  \nFor example, if a sentence states something like “The birthplace of Artemisia Gentileschi is not specified in the sources,” and mentions the entity from the KG, it can be linked to both the relevant sub-graph knowledge (birthplace) and *indicate the necessity of knowledge not present* by tagging it with [NA].\n\nThis duality enables the model to bolster its reliability by accurately signaling knowledge gaps, which helps to improve trustworthiness in the results produced by the language model.\n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "step_response": "## S3: Integration of Definitions and Conditions for Dual Mapping\n\nIn the context of conscious incompetence within the Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) framework, a sentence can simultaneously indicate both '[NA]' (Not Applicable Citation) and relevant sub-graph knowledge through a nuanced understanding of the model's recognition of its limitations while still engaging with available information.\n\n### Explanation of Dual Mapping\n\nThe dual mapping occurs under specific conditions that reflect the model's conscious incompetence. Here’s how these elements integrate:\n\n1. **Acknowledgment of Knowledge Gaps**: A sentence may explicitly indicate that the speaker recognizes their lack of complete knowledge regarding a subject. This acknowledgment is essential for marking the sentence as '[NA]', as it signifies that the model cannot fully substantiate the claim made. For instance, a sentence stating, \"I am unsure about the details of X,\" acknowledges a gap in knowledge.\n\n2. **Reference to Sub-Graph Knowledge**: Despite this acknowledgment, the same sentence can reference specific concepts or elements that are part of the sub-graph knowledge. For example, it might include terms or ideas related to X that are verifiable within the knowledge graph. This allows the model to utilize relevant information while still being transparent about its limitations.\n\n3. **Partial Verifiability**: The conditions for dual mapping highlight that a sentence can contain partially verifiable information. While some aspects of the sentence may be supported by existing knowledge, others may not be fully substantiated. Thus, the model can mark the sentence as '[NA]' while still leveraging the verifiable components.\n\n4. **Uncertain Claims**: When a sentence includes uncertain or ambiguous claims, it can lead to dual mapping. The model acknowledges these uncertainties by designating the sentence as '[NA]', while still referencing any relevant sub-graph knowledge that may apply. For instance, \"The effects of X are unclear, but it is related to Y,\" illustrates this duality.\n\n5. **Contextual Cues**: Sentences that include contextual hints suggesting uncertainty about the information can also map to both '[NA]' and sub-graph knowledge. This allows the model to communicate its limitations effectively while still engaging with the relevant data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, a sentence can indicate both '[NA]' and relevant sub-graph knowledge when it acknowledges knowledge gaps while referencing related concepts. This dual mapping enhances the model's reliability and transparency, allowing it to recognize its limitations while still utilizing available information. By integrating these definitions and conditions, we see how conscious incompetence plays a critical role in the effective functioning of language models within the KaLMA framework.",
