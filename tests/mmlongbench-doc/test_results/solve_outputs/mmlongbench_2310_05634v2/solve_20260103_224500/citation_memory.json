      "raw_result": "**Conscious Incompetence** refers to a psychological stage where an individual is aware of their lack of knowledge or skills related to a specific task or subject area. In the context of language models, particularly within the framework of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), this term is used to describe the model’s capability to recognize when the supporting knowledge required to answer a question is absent from the provided knowledge graph.\n\n### Relation to Sentence Mapping\n\nIn the KaLMA framework, sentences generated by the language model can be linked to knowledge from a structured knowledge graph. The concept of conscious incompetence plays a critical role in how these sentences are mapped:\n\n- **Not Applicable Citations ([NA])**: A sentence generated by the model may require knowledge that is not available in the knowledge graph. In such cases, the model recognizes this gap by marking the corresponding part of the generated sentence with a special token `[NA]`. This serves as an indicator that the knowledge needed to substantiate the assertion made in that sentence is missing.\n\n- **Evaluation Framework**: The mapping of sentences to knowledge (or noting where knowledge is absent) is vital for evaluating the performance of the language model. The model's ability to correctly identify when it lacks sufficient knowledge is indicative of its \"conscious incompetence.\" This is essential in developing trust in the outputs of the model, as it helps users verify uncertain claims rather than allowing the model to fabricate answers.\n\nThis awareness of knowledge gaps ensures that the model does not provide misleading citations or claims, thereby enhancing the reliability of generated content. Thus, conscious incompetence not only informs how the model generates and evaluates its outputs but also significantly affects the quality of sentence mapping to the knowledge available in the graph.\n\n### References\n* [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

Specifically, this occurs under the following conditions:\n\n1. **Partial Verification**: The sentence can be partially verified by existing knowledge in the knowledge graph. This means that while some elements of the sentence have corresponding nodes and edges within the graph, others do not, resulting in a mix of supported and unsupported claims.\n\n2. **Absence of Complete Knowledge**: The sentence must include knowledge that is explicitly absent from the retrieved knowledge graph. Here, the **[NA]** citation acts as an indicator of the knowledge gap acknowledged by the model, illuminating areas where the model recognizes a lack of information necessary to provide a conclusive answer.\n\n3. **Identification of Uncertain Claims**: The mapping to **[NA]** signifies that the model detects a need for additional supporting knowledge that is currently not accessible in the knowledge graph, demonstrating the model’s ability to indicate when it lacks sufficient information, rather than fabricating an answer.\n\nBy identifying such sentences, the model exemplifies the concept of conscious incompetence, showing awareness of its limitations regarding the available knowledge, which enhances the overall trustworthiness of the generated answer.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In the context of \"Conscious Incompetence\" within the Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), a sentence can map to both a [NA] (Not Applicable Citation) and sub-graph knowledge under specific conditions. These conditions are tied to the model's ability to identify gaps in knowledge present in the knowledge graph (KG).\n\n### Conditions for Dual Mapping\n\n1. **Verification Requirement**: The sentence must require external knowledge that is absent or not fully covered by the provided knowledge graph. This means that while some aspects can be verified with existing knowledge, others cannot.\n\n2. **Partial Validation**: The sentence can refer to multiple pieces of knowledge, where at least one piece of knowledge necessary for a complete verification is missing from the knowledge graph. Thus, while the sentence has a portion that aligns with existing knowledge, it also has segments that necessitate acknowledgment of the missing information.\n\n3. **Context of Absent Knowledge**: The presence of [NA] indicates that there is a specific need for supporting knowledge that is recognized as unavailable in the KG during the generation process. For instance, if a sentence claims that a certain fact is true based on partial evidence from the KG, the lack of confirmation for that particular claim makes the [NA] relevant.\n\n4. **Inclusion of Contextual Cues**: The structure of the sentence may inherently suggest that certain aspects are uncertain or require further verification, such as phrases indicating assumption or dependency on unverified knowledge.\n\nBy meeting these conditions, the system exhibits an understanding of its own limitations and effectively communicates uncertainty when referencing knowledge that cannot be definitively cited, thus reflecting the model's conscious incompetence.\n\n### Implications\n\nThis dual mapping not only enhances the model's reliability by disclosing when it lacks certain pieces of information, but also allows users to discern which parts of the answer are well-supported by the knowledge graph, and which parts require additional verification.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

In the context of **Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA)**, it describes a situation where a language model (LLM) recognizes that it doesn't have sufficient knowledge to adequately support certain statements it generates. \n\nIn this framework:\n- When generating answers, if the model encounters a piece of knowledge that it cannot verify from the knowledge graph (KG), it marks the corresponding sentence with a **Not Applicable Citation** (denoted as [NA]).

      "raw_result": "**Conscious Incompetence in Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution**\n\nIn the context of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), \"Conscious Incompetence\" relates to the model's ability to identify the need for supporting knowledge that is absent from the knowledge graph (KG). The term is derived from psychological concepts where an individual recognizes their own lack of knowledge in a particular area.\n\n### Definitions:\n- **Conscious Incompetence**: This is a state where a language model acknowledges the presence of a knowledge gap. It recognizes that certain supporting information needed to formulate a comprehensive answer is missing from the retrieved KG.\n  \n### Conditions for Indicating [NA] and Relevant Sub-graph Knowledge:\n- A generated sentence can be associated with the Not Applicable Citation ([NA]) if it requires certain knowledge for verification that is not found in the knowledge graph.\n- A sentence may also map to relevant sub-graph knowledge from the KG if it can be partially verified. This happens when:\n  - The sentence explicitly references knowledge that is indeed present in the KG.\n  - In addition, the sentence expresses a need for knowledge that is absent, which would prompt the marking of that part as [NA].\n  \nFor example, if a sentence states something like “The birthplace of Artemisia Gentileschi is not specified in the sources,” and mentions the entity from the KG, it can be linked to both the relevant sub-graph knowledge (birthplace) and *indicate the necessity of knowledge not present* by tagging it with [NA].\n\nThis duality enables the model to bolster its reliability by accurately signaling knowledge gaps, which helps to improve trustworthiness in the results produced by the language model.\n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
