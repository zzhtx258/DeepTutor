      "raw_result": "**Conscious Incompetence** refers to a psychological stage where an individual is aware of their lack of knowledge or skills related to a specific task or subject area. In the context of language models, particularly within the framework of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), this term is used to describe the model’s capability to recognize when the supporting knowledge required to answer a question is absent from the provided knowledge graph.\n\n### Relation to Sentence Mapping\n\nIn the KaLMA framework, sentences generated by the language model can be linked to knowledge from a structured knowledge graph. The concept of conscious incompetence plays a critical role in how these sentences are mapped:\n\n- **Not Applicable Citations ([NA])**: A sentence generated by the model may require knowledge that is not available in the knowledge graph. In such cases, the model recognizes this gap by marking the corresponding part of the generated sentence with a special token `[NA]`. This serves as an indicator that the knowledge needed to substantiate the assertion made in that sentence is missing.\n\n- **Evaluation Framework**: The mapping of sentences to knowledge (or noting where knowledge is absent) is vital for evaluating the performance of the language model. The model's ability to correctly identify when it lacks sufficient knowledge is indicative of its \"conscious incompetence.\" This is essential in developing trust in the outputs of the model, as it helps users verify uncertain claims rather than allowing the model to fabricate answers.\n\nThis awareness of knowledge gaps ensures that the model does not provide misleading citations or claims, thereby enhancing the reliability of generated content. Thus, conscious incompetence not only informs how the model generates and evaluates its outputs but also significantly affects the quality of sentence mapping to the knowledge available in the graph.\n\n### References\n* [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In the context of **conscious incompetence**, a sentence can map to both the **[NA]** (Not Applicable Citation) and sub-graph knowledge when it includes some knowledge that requires verification but is not fully supported by the available knowledge graph. Specifically, this occurs under the following conditions:\n\n1. **Partial Verification**: The sentence can be partially verified by existing knowledge in the knowledge graph. This means that while some elements of the sentence have corresponding nodes and edges within the graph, others do not, resulting in a mix of supported and unsupported claims.\n\n2. **Absence of Complete Knowledge**: The sentence must include knowledge that is explicitly absent from the retrieved knowledge graph. Here, the **[NA]** citation acts as an indicator of the knowledge gap acknowledged by the model, illuminating areas where the model recognizes a lack of information necessary to provide a conclusive answer.\n\n3. **Identification of Uncertain Claims**: The mapping to **[NA]** signifies that the model detects a need for additional supporting knowledge that is currently not accessible in the knowledge graph, demonstrating the model’s ability to indicate when it lacks sufficient information, rather than fabricating an answer.\n\nBy identifying such sentences, the model exemplifies the concept of conscious incompetence, showing awareness of its limitations regarding the available knowledge, which enhances the overall trustworthiness of the generated answer.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In the context of the \"Conscious Incompetence\" setting for Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), a sentence can map to both a Not Applicable Citation ([NA]) and sub-graph knowledge when it includes some knowledge that requires verification, but the complete supporting knowledge is absent from the knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, the conditions are as follows:\n\n- **Verification Requirement**: The sentence should express a piece of information that necessitates supporting knowledge to substantiate its claim.\n- **Absence of Complete Supporting Knowledge**: While the sentence can be partially verified by knowledge present in the KG, there must be certain critical knowledge that is missing from the KG. This missing knowledge is what prompts the [NA] designation.\n- **Dual Mapping Ability**: The sentence effectively acknowledges that parts of its content can be backed by citations from the KG, while simultaneously recognizing that some elements are unsupported, thus requiring the [NA] token to indicate the knowledge gap.\n\nThis dual mapping capability enables the language model to identify and represent its limitations regarding knowledge retrieval, fostering greater reliability and trustworthiness in its responses when the knowledge graph is incomplete. \n\nThe introduction of this setting enhances the model's ability to signal gaps in knowledge, which is critical for transparency in generated responses.\n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In the context of \"Conscious Incompetence\" within the Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), a sentence can map to both a [NA] (Not Applicable Citation) and sub-graph knowledge under specific conditions. These conditions are tied to the model's ability to identify gaps in knowledge present in the knowledge graph (KG).\n\n### Conditions for Dual Mapping\n\n1. **Verification Requirement**: The sentence must require external knowledge that is absent or not fully covered by the provided knowledge graph. This means that while some aspects can be verified with existing knowledge, others cannot.\n\n2. **Partial Validation**: The sentence can refer to multiple pieces of knowledge, where at least one piece of knowledge necessary for a complete verification is missing from the knowledge graph. Thus, while the sentence has a portion that aligns with existing knowledge, it also has segments that necessitate acknowledgment of the missing information.\n\n3. **Context of Absent Knowledge**: The presence of [NA] indicates that there is a specific need for supporting knowledge that is recognized as unavailable in the KG during the generation process. For instance, if a sentence claims that a certain fact is true based on partial evidence from the KG, the lack of confirmation for that particular claim makes the [NA] relevant.\n\n4. **Inclusion of Contextual Cues**: The structure of the sentence may inherently suggest that certain aspects are uncertain or require further verification, such as phrases indicating assumption or dependency on unverified knowledge.\n\nBy meeting these conditions, the system exhibits an understanding of its own limitations and effectively communicates uncertainty when referencing knowledge that cannot be definitively cited, thus reflecting the model's conscious incompetence.\n\n### Implications\n\nThis dual mapping not only enhances the model's reliability by disclosing when it lacks certain pieces of information, but also allows users to discern which parts of the answer are well-supported by the knowledge graph, and which parts require additional verification.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

This dual mapping helps the model communicate its limitations and enhances reliability by distinguishing well-supported information from that which requires further verification.",

      "raw_result": "**Conscious Incompetence** is a psychological concept that refers to the awareness of one's lack of knowledge or skill in a certain area. In the context of **Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA)**, it describes a situation where a language model (LLM) recognizes that it doesn't have sufficient knowledge to adequately support certain statements it generates. \n\nIn this framework:\n- When generating answers, if the model encounters a piece of knowledge that it cannot verify from the knowledge graph (KG), it marks the corresponding sentence with a **Not Applicable Citation** (denoted as [NA]). This marking serves as an indicator that the model acknowledges the absence of necessary knowledge.\n- Additionally, a sentence may map to both a [NA] citation and specific sub-graph knowledge if some knowledge is partially verifiable by the KG.
