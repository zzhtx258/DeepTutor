      "raw_result": "The concept of **Conscious Incompetence** is defined within the context of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) as a specific evaluation setting where large language models (LLMs) are tested on their ability to recognize and explicitly indicate when required knowledge for generating an accurate response is absent from the provided knowledge graph (KG). This state reflects the model’s “awareness” of its own limitations — hence the term “conscious” — in situations where the underlying KG lacks the necessary factual triplets to support a generated sentence.\n\n### Relationship to Sentence Mapping to [NA]\n\nIn this framework, when a model generates a sentence that depends on knowledge not present in the retrieved KG, it is expected to mark that sentence with **[NA]** (Not Applicable Citation). The [NA] marker serves as a direct indicator of a knowledge gap. Rather than hallucinating or fabricating unsupported information, the model signals that the statement cannot be grounded in the available structured knowledge. This mapping to [NA] is central to evaluating how well models handle incomplete information — a key component of the Conscious Incompetence setting.\n\nThe evaluation of such [NA]-marked sentences involves checking whether they *entail* any knowledge items from a predefined **Absent Knowledge Set** — a set of ground-truth knowledge triplets intentionally withheld from the KG during testing. Metrics like **NA Precision** and **NA Recall** are then computed based on these entailment checks:\n\n- **NA Precision**: Measures the proportion of [NA]-marked sentences that correctly entail at least one item from the Absent Knowledge Set.\n- **NA Recall**: Measures the proportion of items in the Absent Knowledge Set that are successfully entailed by at least one [NA]-marked sentence.\n\nThese metrics help quantify how reliably models can identify and respond to missing knowledge — essentially measuring their “conscious incompetence.”\n\n### Relationship to Sub-Graph Knowledge\n\nThe term “sub-graph knowledge” refers to the structured portions of the knowledge graph used during retrieval and generation. In KaLMA, the system typically retrieves a **one-hop sub-graph** centered around relevant entities (e.g., a person node in Wikidata), which includes properties like gender, birth date, occupation, etc. When evaluating conscious incompetence, researchers deliberately remove specific triplets from this sub-graph to simulate real-world coverage gaps.\n\nThis removal creates the **Absent Knowledge Set**, which becomes the benchmark against which [NA] citations are evaluated. Thus, the model’s performance under Conscious Incompetence directly depends on its ability to navigate and reason about the structure and limitations of the sub-graph knowledge it has access to. If the model fails to detect that a critical piece of relational knowledge (e.g., “Artemisia Gentileschi was born in Rome”) is missing from the sub-graph, it may generate an ungrounded or incorrectly cited statement — revealing a failure in conscious incompetence.\n\nIn summary, **Conscious Incompetence** is not merely about ignorance, but about the model’s capacity to acknowledge and signal its ignorance through the use of [NA] markers, evaluated against a known set of absent knowledge derived from the sub-graph structure of the KG. This approach enables a more nuanced assessment of LLM reliability in real-world scenarios where knowledge graphs are inherently incomplete.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA)\n- [2] Conscious Incompetence Evaluation\n- [3] Not Applicable Citation\n- [4] NA Precision\n- [5] NA Recall",

      "content": "According to the author's definition in the KaLMA framework, conscious incompetence refers to a model’s ability to recognize when required knowledge is absent from the provided knowledge graph and explicitly mark such sentences with [NA]. A sentence maps to both [NA] and sub-graph knowledge when it entails at least one item from the Absent Knowledge Set — which consists of triplets deliberately removed from the retrieved one-hop sub-graph. This mapping allows evaluation via NA Precision and NA Recall, measuring how reliably the model signals its ignorance while reasoning about the structure and gaps in the sub-graph.",
