      "step_response": "## S1: Interpretation of Conscious Incompetence and Dual Mapping Condition\n\nIn the KaLMA framework, **conscious incompetence** is defined as the capacity of a language model to recognize when the knowledge required to generate or validate a sentence is *not present* in the provided knowledge graph — and to explicitly signal this absence by marking the sentence with `[NA]` [rag-1]. This concept is not merely about failure to answer, but about *awareness of ignorance*, which enables more transparent and evaluable reasoning.\n\nA sentence maps to **both `[NA]` and a list of sub-graph knowledge** under a specific condition: when the sentence **entails at least one item from the Absent Knowledge Set**. The Absent Knowledge Set consists of triplets that were *deliberately removed* from the retrieved one-hop sub-graph during evaluation setup [rag-1]. \n\nThis dual mapping arises because:\n- The sentence still relates semantically to entities or relations within the *available* sub-graph (hence it maps to sub-graph knowledge).\n- However, it also depends on *missing* knowledge (from the Absent Knowledge Set), which triggers the `[NA]` flag to indicate the model’s recognition of its own incompleteness.\n\nThis mechanism allows for precise evaluation metrics such as **NA Precision** and **NA Recall**, which measure how reliably the model signals its ignorance while still engaging with the structural context of the sub-graph [rag-1].\n\nIn essence, the condition for dual mapping is not accidental — it is engineered to test whether the model can simultaneously reason over available structure *and* acknowledge gaps in knowledge, embodying true conscious incompetence.\n\n---\n\nThis step establishes the foundational definition and mapping logic required to evaluate models under the KaLMA framework. The next step will explore how this mapping is operationalized in practice through evaluation metrics.",
