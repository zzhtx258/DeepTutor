      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit chart or table that lists **exact alignment scores for ChatGPT at different temperature settings (0.1, 0.5, 0.9)** as discrete values per setting.\n\nHowever, the following relevant information is available:\n\n- ChatGPT was evaluated across temperature settings of **0.1, 0.5, and 0.9**, but evaluations consistently show **minimal performance variation** across these settings — particularly in metrics such as **F1 Score** and **text-citation alignment**.\n  \n- In automated evaluation, ChatGPT achieved a **text-citation alignment score of 84.5** (with temperature 0.5 being the standard setting used in retrieval analysis experiments).\n  \n- Human evaluation of ChatGPT’s text-citation alignment yielded a score of **82.0**, with the difference attributed to methodological variance rather than instability in model performance.\n\n- The relationship between temperature and performance is described as having **negligible impact** on citation quality or alignment scores — meaning that while temperature settings were tested, **no significant differences in alignment scores were observed** across them.\n\nIn summary:  \nWhile **ChatGPT’s alignment score is reported as 84.5 (automated) and 82.0 (human)**, these scores are not broken down by individual temperature settings (0.1, 0.5, 0.9), because **no meaningful variation was found** across those settings. Therefore, no exact per-temperature alignment scores are presented in any table or chart.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] ChatGPT\n- [2] Temperature Setting\n- [3] Text-Citation Alignment\n- [4] Human Evaluation of Text-Citation Alignment (Table 6) (table)\n- [5] Citation Quality Evaluation Across LLMs (Table 3) (table)",
