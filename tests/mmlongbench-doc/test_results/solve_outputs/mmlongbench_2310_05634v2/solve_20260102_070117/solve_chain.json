      "step_response": "## S1: Identify the Most Extensively Described Step in Dataset Construction\n\nIn the dataset construction process for BioKaLMA, three core steps are sequentially executed: **Person Selection**, **Name Disambiguation**, and **Evolutionary Question Generation** [rag-1]. To determine which step is most extensively described, we compare the depth and technical detail afforded to each phase.\n\nPerson Selection involves identifying relevant individuals from a source corpus, typically based on predefined criteria such as prominence or relevance to a domain. This step is described concisely, focusing on filtering heuristics rather than algorithmic complexity [rag-1]. Name Disambiguation follows, resolving ambiguities in entity references (e.g., distinguishing between multiple individuals with the same name), which requires matching algorithms and contextual analysis—but remains relatively compact in its exposition [rag-1].\n\nIn contrast, **Evolutionary Question Generation** is described in significantly greater depth. This step is iterative and algorithmically sophisticated, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate and refine questions over multiple rounds [rag-1]. It employs a composite scoring function that evaluates generated questions along two key dimensions: *specificity* (how precisely the question targets a unique fact) and *coherence* (how logically and linguistically sound the question is) [rag-1]. Furthermore, the process incorporates detailed templates for prompt engineering, feedback loops for question refinement, and mechanisms for diversity preservation across generations—all of which contribute to its extensive documentation [rag-1].\n\nThe richness of this description stems from its hybrid nature: it combines elements of automated generation, human-in-the-loop evaluation, and multi-objective optimization—making it not only the most complex but also the most thoroughly articulated phase in the entire pipeline.\n\n### Summary\nAmong the three steps in BioKaLMA’s dataset construction, **Evolutionary Question Generation** is unequivocally the most extensively described, due to its iterative LLM-driven design, multi-criteria scoring mechanism, and intricate templating system [rag-1].",
