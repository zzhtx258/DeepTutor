      "raw_result": "Figure 1 from the provided context illustrates the Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) task setup through a schematic diagram. It depicts a three-part structure: Input (Question), Knowledge Graph Retrieval, and Output (Generated Answer with Citations). The knowledge graph (KG) is represented as a node-link structure, where entities are shown as circular nodes connected by directed, labeled edges that represent semantic relations.\n\nIn this diagram, the central node corresponds to the retrieved query entity — “2018 FIFA World Cup” — which is highlighted in bright blue. From this central node, directed edges (arrows) extend outward to related entities: “France” (via the relation “DID_WIN”), “Didier Deschamps” (via “COACH_OF”), and “Russia” (via “HOST_COUNTRY”). These connected nodes — “France,” “Didier Deschamps,” and “Russia” — are leaf nodes in the knowledge graph, meaning they have no outgoing edges of their own in this sub-graph. They represent the terminal points of the retrieved knowledge, serving as the direct sources for generating the attributed answer.\n\nThe underlining convention in the diagram distinguishes query entities (blue underline in the question) from citation entities (green underline in the output). The generated answer — “The coach of the team that won the 2018 FIFA World Cup was Didier Deschamps.” — contains the green-underlined citation “Didier Deschamps,” directly linked via the “COACH_OF” edge to the central entity in the knowledge graph. This visual design emphasizes how the system grounds each generated claim in a specific triplet from the structured knowledge graph.\n\nThe diagram’s layout clearly shows the flow from the question to the knowledge graph retrieval and finally to the attributed output, with the leaf nodes acting as the final, verifiable knowledge sources that support the answer’s claims. The absence of further outgoing edges from these leaf nodes confirms their role as endpoints in the one-hop sub-graph retrieval.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "content": "In Figure 1, the relation arrows point from the central entity '2018 FIFA World Cup' to three leaf nodes: 'France,' 'Didier Deschamps,' and 'Russia.' These leaf nodes are terminal points in the knowledge graph sub-graph, meaning no arrows originate from them to other nodes. Therefore, all relation arrows in the diagram point to specific leaf nodes; there are no arrows that fail to point to leaf nodes.",
