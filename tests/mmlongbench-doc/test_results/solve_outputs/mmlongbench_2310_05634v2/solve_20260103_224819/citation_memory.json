      "raw_result": "**Conscious Incompetence** refers to a psychological stage where an individual is aware of their lack of knowledge or skills related to a specific task or subject area. In the context of language models, particularly within the framework of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), this term is used to describe the model’s capability to recognize when the supporting knowledge required to answer a question is absent from the provided knowledge graph.\n\n### Relation to Sentence Mapping\n\nIn the KaLMA framework, sentences generated by the language model can be linked to knowledge from a structured knowledge graph. The concept of conscious incompetence plays a critical role in how these sentences are mapped:\n\n- **Not Applicable Citations ([NA])**: A sentence generated by the model may require knowledge that is not available in the knowledge graph. In such cases, the model recognizes this gap by marking the corresponding part of the generated sentence with a special token `[NA]`. This serves as an indicator that the knowledge needed to substantiate the assertion made in that sentence is missing.\n\n- **Evaluation Framework**: The mapping of sentences to knowledge (or noting where knowledge is absent) is vital for evaluating the performance of the language model. The model's ability to correctly identify when it lacks sufficient knowledge is indicative of its \"conscious incompetence.\" This is essential in developing trust in the outputs of the model, as it helps users verify uncertain claims rather than allowing the model to fabricate answers.\n\nThis awareness of knowledge gaps ensures that the model does not provide misleading citations or claims, thereby enhancing the reliability of generated content. Thus, conscious incompetence not only informs how the model generates and evaluates its outputs but also significantly affects the quality of sentence mapping to the knowledge available in the graph.\n\n### References\n* [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In the framework of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA), a sentence can map to either a Not Applicable Citation ([NA]) or sub-graph knowledge based on certain conditions. Here's a structured overview of these conditions:\n\n### Conditions for Mapping to [NA]\n1. **Absence of Required Knowledge**:\n   - A sentence is marked with [NA] if it references knowledge that is not present in the retrieved knowledge graph (KG).\n2. **Need for Verification**:\n   - If the sentence requires supporting knowledge that is absent from the KG, it is an indication of a knowledge gap, warranting a [NA] marking as it signifies the model's recognition of its own limits.\n3. **Correct Identification of Gaps**:\n   - The system's ability to identify when knowledge is missing is indicated by a stable recall metric of approximately 15%, regardless of the absence levels in knowledge.\n\n### Conditions for Mapping to Sub-Graph Knowledge\n1. **Existence in the Knowledge Graph**:\n   - Sentences that can be fully verified by the knowledge present in the KG are mapped to corresponding sub-graph knowledge.\n2. **Complete Knowledge Triplet**:\n   - A sentence may carry a reference to knowledge that is adequately represented by knowledge triplets in the KG, allowing for a clear association between the sentence content and the factual information.\n3. **Partial Verification**:\n   - A sentence can map to both [NA] and sub-graph knowledge if it can be partially verified by existing knowledge, indicating a nuanced understanding of the availability of relevant information.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the **[NA]** designation highlights when the model acknowledges the absence of necessary information while retaining precision in knowledge attribution through references to existing entities within the knowledge graph. This dual mapping capability enhances the robustness of the KaLMA framework in addressing knowledge gaps.\n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In the context of the paper, the authors define \"Conscious Incompetence\" as a task setting that acknowledges a model’s awareness of knowledge gaps during the answer generation process. Specifically, when a system encounters a situation where required knowledge is absent from the knowledge graph (KG), it can mark a generated sentence with a \"Not Applicable Citation\" (indicated as [NA]). \n\nThis means that if a sentence in the output text references knowledge that cannot be validated against the provided KG, it can be flagged as needing verification. Consequently, a sentence may be attributed to both an [NA] citation and a list of sub-graph knowledge if it can be only partially validated by the KG. The [NA] marker serves not as a traditional citation but as an indicator that there exists a knowledge gap, demonstrating the model's capability to identify when it lacks sufficient information to generate a valid citation. This \"Conscious Incompetence\" approach enables language models to make users aware of potential uncertainties in the claims being made, which enhances the overall trustworthiness of the generated content. \n\nThis definition and its implications are emphasized throughout the evaluation and experimental findings in the paper, particularly regarding the capability of current large language models (LLMs) to acknowledge and respond appropriately to absent knowledge during the information retrieval process. \n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
