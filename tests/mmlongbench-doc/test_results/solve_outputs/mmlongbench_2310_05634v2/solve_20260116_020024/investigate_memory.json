      "raw_result": "The author defines **Conscious Incompetence** as a task setting extension where large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on their ability to recognize and explicitly mark cases in which required knowledge is absent from the provided knowledge graph (KG). This concept is introduced within the **KaLMA (Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution)** framework, where models generate attributed answers by retrieving entities and relationships from structured KGs. When a generated sentence cannot be supported by any available knowledge triplet in the retrieved sub-graph, it is marked with **[NA]** — denoting “Not Applicable Citation” — to indicate a knowledge gap.\n\nThis mechanism allows models to demonstrate awareness of their own limitations: instead of fabricating or omitting information, they flag statements that rely on missing knowledge. The [NA] marker thus serves as a direct indicator of conscious incompetence — the model acknowledges its inability to ground a claim in the available structured data.\n\nIn evaluation, this setting is operationalized by creating an **Absent Knowledge Set**, which consists of knowledge triplets intentionally removed from the KG prior to generation. Sentences marked with [NA] are then assessed via **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** to determine whether they entail any item from this absent set. Metrics such as **NA Precision** and **NA Recall** are computed based on this alignment:\n\n- **NA Precision** measures how accurately [NA]-marked sentences correspond to actual absent knowledge (i.e., if a sentence entails at least one item from the Absent Knowledge Set).\n- **NA Recall** measures how comprehensively the model identifies all items in the Absent Knowledge Set through [NA]-marked sentences.\n\nThus, conscious incompetence directly relates to sentences mapping to [NA] because these markers reflect the model’s explicit recognition of knowledge gaps. It also connects to the structure of sub-graph knowledge: since the model retrieves only a subset of the full KG (via SPARQL queries or similar methods), the absence of certain triplets in the retrieved sub-graph triggers the [NA] annotation — making the phenomenon both a product of retrieval scope and a measurable aspect of model behavior under constrained knowledge availability.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution\n- [2] Conscious Incompetence\n- [3] [NA] Mark\n- [4] Figure 3 - NA Precision and Recall Evaluation Diagram (image)\n- [5] Section 4.4",
      "summary": "According to the author, conscious incompetence refers to a model's ability to recognize and explicitly mark when a generated sentence cannot be supported by available knowledge in the retrieved sub-graph, using the [NA] marker to indicate a knowledge gap. This occurs when required knowledge triplets are absent from the sub-graph, prompting the model to flag its own limitation rather than fabricate or omit information. The [NA] mapping is thus directly tied to the model’s awareness of missing knowledge within the constrained retrieval scope.",
