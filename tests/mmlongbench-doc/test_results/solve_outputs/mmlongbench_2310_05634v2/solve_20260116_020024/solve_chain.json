      "step_response": "## S1: Interpretation of Conscious Incompetence and Sentence Mapping Conditions\n\nAccording to the author’s definition, **conscious incompetence** refers to a model’s capacity to recognize and explicitly mark instances where a generated sentence cannot be substantiated by the knowledge available in the retrieved sub-graph. This is operationalized through the use of the `[NA]` marker, which signals a knowledge gap — that is, when the required knowledge triplets are absent from the sub-graph. Rather than fabricating or omitting information, the model demonstrates self-awareness by flagging its own limitation [rag-1].\n\nThis mechanism ensures that the model does not hallucinate or suppress uncertainty. Instead, it maps a sentence to `[NA]` precisely under the condition that:\n\n> The required knowledge triplets for supporting the sentence are **not present** in the retrieved sub-graph.\n\nIn contrast, when the necessary knowledge triplets *are* present, the sentence maps to a **list of sub-graph knowledge**, meaning the model can ground its output in verifiable facts from the graph.\n\nThus, the mapping decision — whether to `[NA]` or to a list of sub-graph knowledge — hinges entirely on the **presence or absence of requisite knowledge triplets** within the constrained retrieval scope of the sub-graph.\n\n### Summary\nThe author defines conscious incompetence as the model’s ability to self-flag knowledge gaps using `[NA]` when required triplets are missing from the sub-graph. A sentence maps to `[NA]` if and only if the supporting knowledge is absent; otherwise, it maps to a list of sub-graph knowledge. This design enforces factual grounding and transparency in LLM outputs.",
