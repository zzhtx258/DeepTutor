      "raw_result": "In the context of the provided document, \"Conscious Incompetence\" is adapted from psychological learning theory (Curtiss and Warren, 1974) to the domain of knowledge-aware language model attribution. It refers to a setting in which a language model is capable of recognizing when the knowledge required to generate a valid, supported answer is absent from the provided knowledge graph. Rather than fabricating an answer or citation, the model is designed to explicitly signal this knowledge gap using a special token, [NA] (Not Applicable Citation). This mechanism allows the model to acknowledge its limitations — that is, to be “conscious” of its “incompetence” in the face of missing or unavailable information.\n\nThis concept extends the traditional Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) task by introducing a critical dimension of reliability: the model’s ability to refrain from generating unsupported claims when the underlying knowledge graph is incomplete. The [NA] token serves not as a conventional citation, but as an indicator of a detected knowledge gap, enabling users to identify uncertain or unverifiable claims in the model’s output. Empirical results from the BioKaLMA benchmark show that as knowledge coverage in the graph deteriorates, the precision of the [NA] mechanism increases, indicating that models become better at identifying when they lack sufficient information — a hallmark of conscious incompetence.\n\nThus, within this framework, conscious incompetence is not a failure of the model, but a desired feature that enhances trustworthiness and verifiability in attributed generation.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",

      "query": "conscious incompetence conditions for sentence mapping to both [NA] and sub-graph knowledge",
      "raw_result": "In the Conscious Incompetence setting of the KaLMA task, a sentence in the generated answer can be mapped to both a [NA] token and one or more knowledge triplets from the knowledge graph when the sentence contains a mix of verifiable and unverifiable claims. This occurs when part of the sentence is supported by information present in the retrieved knowledge graph, while another part relies on knowledge that is absent from the graph.\n\nThe [NA] token functions as a marker for knowledge gaps, indicating that a specific claim within the sentence cannot be grounded in the provided knowledge graph. Simultaneously, other parts of the same sentence may still be correctly attributed to valid triplets from the graph. This dual mapping allows the model to acknowledge partial knowledge coverage without hallucinating unsupported claims.\n\nFor example, if a generated sentence states, “Artemisia Gentileschi was taught by Agostino Tassi and was a citizen of Italy,” but the knowledge triplet (Q212657 - country of citizenship - Q3967) has been removed from the knowledge graph, the model may correctly attribute “was taught by Agostino Tassi” to the known triplet (Q212657 - teacher - Q255768), while marking the claim about citizenship with [NA]. In this case, the sentence maps to both a valid knowledge triplet and the [NA] token, reflecting conscious incompetence: the model recognizes its lack of access to the required knowledge for the citizenship claim, while still accurately citing the known mentorship relation.\n\nThis mechanism is evaluated using NA precision and NA recall metrics, where NA recall measures whether the absent knowledge (e.g., country of citizenship) is correctly flagged by the [NA] token, and NA precision ensures that the [NA] mark is only applied when the knowledge is truly absent and not falsely invoked. The presence of both citations and [NA] in a single sentence is a key feature of the Conscious Incompetence setting, enabling nuanced attribution under incomplete knowledge conditions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
