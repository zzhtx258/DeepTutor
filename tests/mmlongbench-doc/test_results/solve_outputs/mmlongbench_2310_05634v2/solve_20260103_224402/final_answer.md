## S1: Analysis of Steps in Dataset Construction

In the process of dataset construction, various steps are involved, each contributing to the creation of a high-quality dataset suitable for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Among these steps, the one that takes the most words to describe is **Evolutionary Question Generation**.

### Evolutionary Question Generation

This step is crucial as it focuses on the iterative enhancement of question complexity. The process begins with a foundational paragraph, which is then extended using additional knowledge from a designated knowledge pool. The key aspects of this step include:

1. **Incremental Complexity**: The questions generated are not static; instead, they evolve over multiple iterations. This evolutionary approach allows for the gradual increase in the sophistication and depth of the questions.

2. **Iterative Annotation**: During each iteration, the original paragraph is annotated with new information. This not only enriches the content but also ensures that the generated questions are relevant and comprehensive.

3. **Diverse Question Generation**: After several iterations, the LLMs produce both general and specific versions of questions. This diversity is essential as it targets various aspects of the same set of knowledge, catering to different evaluation needs.

The detailed nature of the **Evolutionary Question Generation** step, which encompasses these intricate processes, is what makes it the most verbose in description compared to other steps in dataset construction. This thoroughness is vital for ensuring that the dataset is robust and capable of effectively assessing the capabilities of LLMs.

In summary, the **Evolutionary Question Generation** step stands out in the dataset construction process due to its complexity and the depth of explanation required to fully capture its significance and methodology.

## S2: Analysis of the Most Extensive Description in Dataset Construction

In the context of dataset construction, the step that requires the most extensive description is **Evolutionary Question Generation**. This step is pivotal for developing a high-quality dataset tailored for evaluating large language models (LLMs). 

### Detailed Explanation of Evolutionary Question Generation

**Evolutionary Question Generation** is characterized by several key processes that contribute to its complexity and the depth of explanation it necessitates:

1. **Incremental Complexity**: The questions generated are designed to evolve through multiple iterations. This evolutionary approach allows for a gradual increase in the sophistication and depth of the questions, ensuring that they are not merely repetitive but progressively challenging.

2. **Iterative Annotation**: Each iteration involves annotating the original foundational paragraph with new information sourced from a designated knowledge pool. This iterative process enriches the content, ensuring that the questions generated are both relevant and comprehensive. It emphasizes the importance of context and the integration of diverse knowledge.

3. **Diverse Question Generation**: After several iterations, the LLMs produce a variety of questions, including both general and specific versions. This diversity is crucial as it addresses multiple facets of the same knowledge base, catering to different evaluation needs and enhancing the robustness of the dataset.

The intricate nature of these processes makes the **Evolutionary Question Generation** step significantly more verbose compared to other steps in the dataset construction process. The thoroughness required to articulate these methodologies is essential for ensuring that the dataset is capable of effectively assessing the capabilities of LLMs.

In summary, the **Evolutionary Question Generation** step stands out due to its complexity and the comprehensive explanation needed to fully capture its significance and methodology in the dataset construction process.
