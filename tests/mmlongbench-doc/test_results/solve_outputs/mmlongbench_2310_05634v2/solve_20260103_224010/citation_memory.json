      "raw_result": "Figure 1 in the provided context showcases the Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) task setup. It consists of a question, a knowledge graph (KG) retrieval structure, and the corresponding generated answer with citations. \n\nIn this diagram, the relationship arrows are structured to demonstrate how entities within the knowledge graph are interconnected. While the arrows lead to nodes that represent specific entities (like the coach and team in the FIFA World Cup question), not all arrows necessarily point to leaf nodes, which represent entities with no further connections.\n\nTypically, arrows that do not terminate at specific leaf nodes may indicate:\n\n- **Intermediate Nodes:** Arrows may lead to nodes that serve as intermediates in the relationships rather than terminal entities, thus illustrating how entities interact within the KG.\n\n- **Conceptual Representations:** Such arrows could also represent broader categories or relationships that may encompass multiple entities or further branching, indicating the possible directions for retrieval and the scope of relationships within the KG.\n\nIn summary, while specific details regarding nodes and their connections in Figure 1 were not detailed, the structure generally implies an interconnectedness within the knowledge graph, allowing for a variety of paths through the relationships represented by the arrows. This complexity is crucial for understanding how questions relate to the structured knowledge contained in KGs.\n\n### References\n- [1] 2310.05634v2.pdf",
