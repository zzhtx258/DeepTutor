      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Relation Arrows in Figure 1\n\nIn Figure 1, the relation arrows that do not point to specific leaf nodes are characterized by their connection to intermediate nodes or broader categories. These arrows illustrate relationships that extend beyond individual data points, indicating a more complex structure within the knowledge graph.\n\n### Characteristics of Non-Terminal Relation Arrows\n\n1. **Connection to Intermediate Nodes**: The arrows that lead to intermediate nodes signify that they are part of a larger conceptual framework. These nodes serve as connectors that facilitate relationships between various categories or entities within the graph.\n\n2. **Representation of Broader Categories**: Some arrows represent broader categories rather than specific instances. This means they encapsulate a range of related concepts or entities, allowing for a more generalized understanding of the relationships depicted in the diagram.\n\n3. **Illustration of Conceptual Relationships**: The non-terminal arrows highlight how different entities are interconnected, emphasizing the pathways through which information can flow in the knowledge graph. This structure allows for various interpretations and connections, showcasing the complexity of the relationships involved.\n\nIn summary, the relation arrows in Figure 1 that do not point to specific leaf nodes typically connect to intermediate nodes or represent broader conceptual relationships. This design illustrates the interconnectedness of entities within the knowledge graph, emphasizing the importance of these non-terminal connections in understanding the overall structure.",
