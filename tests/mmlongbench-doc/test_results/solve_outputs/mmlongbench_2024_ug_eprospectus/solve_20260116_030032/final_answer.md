## S1: Identification of Figures Without Human Presence in NTU Smart Campus Visuals

To address the question, we must first clarify that while the “Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You” is referenced as a thematic section in promotional materials [rag-8], there is no explicit one-to-one mapping between each numbered reason and a specific figure or image. However, based on available visual descriptions associated with the broader NTU Smart Campus campaign, we can identify which figures—potentially used to illustrate or support these reasons—do not include any human presence.

According to the provided analysis, five such figures are explicitly described as excluding people:

1. **Top 10 Reasons Title Card** — This is likely the introductory graphic for the section and contains no human figures.
2. **UG Lounge Interior (no people shown)** — A depiction of a lounge space where no individuals are present in the frame.
3. **Icon Representation (stylized buildings)** — A symbolic, abstract representation of campus architecture, rendered without human elements.
4. **Sustainability Icon (building + leaf)** — A composite icon combining a building silhouette with a leaf symbol, emphasizing environmental themes without human imagery.
5. **Digital Interface Icon (monitor with interface elements)** — A stylized depiction of a digital screen displaying interface components, focused purely on technology.

These visuals serve to communicate key themes—such as infrastructure, sustainability, and digital innovation—through architectural, symbolic, or technological representations rather than through depictions of human activity. While we cannot definitively assign each of these figures to a specific numbered reason from the “Top 10,” they are thematically aligned with the messaging of the campaign and represent the subset of visuals that exclude human presence.

Thus, any of these five figures could be associated with one or more of the top 10 reasons, depending on how the content was visually structured in the original material. The absence of human figures in these images suggests an intentional design choice to emphasize systems, spaces, or symbols over individual experiences.

In summary, although direct linkage between each reason and its corresponding figure is not documented, the available evidence confirms that at least five distinct visuals associated with the NTU Smart Campus campaign do not include any person. These are: the Top 10 Reasons Title Card, UG Lounge Interior (no people shown), Icon Representation, Sustainability Icon, and Digital Interface Icon.

## S2: Thematic Alignment Analysis — Linking Person-Free Figures to Top 10 Reasons

Although no explicit mapping exists between the “Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You” and their corresponding visual figures [rag-8], we can reasonably infer thematic associations based on the nature of the person-free visuals and the general themes referenced in the campaign.

The five identified figures that exclude human presence — namely, the **Top 10 Reasons Title Card**, **UG Lounge Interior (no people shown)**, **Icon Representation (stylized buildings)**, **Sustainability Icon (building + leaf)**, and **Digital Interface Icon (monitor with interface elements)** — are thematically aligned with abstract, systemic, or symbolic representations rather than experiential or human-centric narratives. This suggests they are most likely associated with reasons that emphasize infrastructure, technology, or environmental values — areas where visual communication often relies on icons, architecture, or interfaces rather than depictions of individuals.

Among the broader themes mentioned in the campaign — such as smart access, sustainability, immersive learning, and campus life — two stand out as particularly compatible with person-free imagery:

- **Sustainability**: The “Sustainability Icon (building + leaf)” directly visualizes this theme through symbolic representation. Since sustainability initiatives often focus on systems, energy efficiency, and ecological design — not necessarily individual behavior — it is plausible that this icon supports a reason centered on environmental responsibility or green campus infrastructure [rag-1].

- **Smart Technology / Digital Innovation**: The “Digital Interface Icon (monitor with interface elements)” aligns with themes like smart access, digital learning platforms, or campus-wide connectivity. These concepts are inherently technological and can be effectively communicated through interface graphics without requiring human figures.

While other reasons — such as “immersive learning” or “campus life” — imply active student engagement and would typically be illustrated with people, the absence of human presence in these specific figures makes them less likely candidates for those reasons.

Thus, even in the absence of an explicit one-to-one mapping, **the reason most likely associated with a figure that excludes any person is either “Sustainability” or “Smart Technology”**, based on thematic congruence and the nature of the visual symbols used [tool-execution-result].

In summary, while definitive assignment remains impossible due to lack of direct documentation, logical inference from available materials strongly suggests that the person-free figures correspond to reasons emphasizing systemic, technological, or environmental themes — particularly “Sustainability” and “Smart Technology.”

    The provided result confirms the existence of a section titled 'Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You' but does not list the actual numbered reasons. It describes associated themes like smart access, sustainability, immersive learning, and campus life — many of which imply human presence (e.g., student interaction, collaborative spaces). However, no specific figure or reason is described in enough detail to determine whether any exclude people. The document mentions visual materials (e.g., title card, lounge interior) but does not specify their content. Therefore, it is not possible to identify which reason — if any — corresponds to a figure without persons.

    Among the figures associated with the NTU Smart Campus themes (potentially supporting the 'Top 10 Reasons' section), five do not include human presence: the Top 10 Reasons Title Card, UG Lounge Interior (no people shown), Icon Representation (stylized buildings), Sustainability Icon (building + leaf), and Digital Interface Icon (monitor with interface elements). These focus on architecture, symbols, or technology rather than human activity. While no direct mapping of figures to each of the 10 reasons is provided, these visuals are relevant to the campaign’s messaging.
