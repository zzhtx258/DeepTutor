      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, while there is a clear reference to a section titled **“Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You”** — appearing as both a graphic title card and a listed section in the prospectus — the actual *list of the top 10 reasons* is not detailed in the available knowledge graph or document chunks.\n\nThe context confirms that this section exists to promote the NTU Smart Campus to prospective students and is visually supported by imagery such as the “NTU Smart Campus UG Lounge Interior with Contents Overlay” and the “NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card.” These materials emphasize themes like:\n\n- **All-In-One Convenience** (via Smart Pass for access and payments)\n- **Green & Sustainable Campus** (eco-friendly infrastructure)\n- **Immersive Learning** (digital tools, flipped classrooms)\n- **Vibrant Campus Life** (student interaction, clubs, events)\n- **Smart Mobility Experience Centre** (real-time shuttle updates)\n- **Open-Plan Layouts & Light-Colored Wood Interiors** (collaborative, natural spaces)\n- **Food and Retail Services** (accessible dining/shopping at North Spine Plaza)\n- **IT Services & NTU Maps** (navigation, connectivity, virtual learning)\n- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration** (students from diverse fields working together)\n- **Global Exposure & Leadership Development** (programs like OGEM, Impactful Leadership)\n\nHowever, these are *features* and *themes* associated with the campus, not an explicit numbered list of “top 10 reasons.”\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe specific “Top 10 Reasons” are not enumerated in the provided context. The information available only confirms the *existence* of such a section and its thematic focus areas. To obtain the full list, you would need to consult the official NTU prospectus or promotional materials where this section is fully detailed.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card (image)\n- [2] Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You\n- [3] NTU Smart Campus UG Lounge Interior with Contents Overlay (image)\n- [4] NTU Prospectus\n- [5] NTU Smart Campus",
      "summary": "The provided result confirms the existence of a section titled 'Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You' but does not list the actual numbered reasons. It describes associated themes like smart access, sustainability, immersive learning, and campus life — many of which imply human presence (e.g., student interaction, collaborative spaces). However, no specific figure or reason is described in enough detail to determine whether any exclude people. The document mentions visual materials (e.g., title card, lounge interior) but does not specify their content. Therefore, it is not possible to identify which reason — if any — corresponds to a figure without persons.",
