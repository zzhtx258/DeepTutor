The information available only confirms the *existence* of such a section and its thematic focus areas. To obtain the full list, you would need to consult the official NTU prospectus or promotional materials where this section is fully detailed.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card (image)\n- [2] Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You\n- [3] NTU Smart Campus UG Lounge Interior with Contents Overlay (image)\n- [4] NTU Prospectus\n- [5] NTU Smart Campus",

      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit list of “Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You” with corresponding numbered figures or images directly tied to each reason. The entity “Top 10 Reasons Why NTU Smart Campus Is For You” is referenced as a section title in the prospectus and as part of promotional graphics (e.g., “NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card”), but no document chunks or knowledge graph data break down the ten reasons individually or assign specific figures to each.\n\nHowever, several images and icons are associated with the broader concept of the NTU Smart Campus and its features, which may implicitly support the messaging behind such a top-10 list:\n\n### Figures Associated with NTU Smart Campus Themes (Potentially Supporting the “Top 10 Reasons”):\n\n1. **NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card (image)** — This is the primary visual anchor for the section, featuring bold text and abstract shapes, but it does not include human presence.\n2. **NTU Smart Campus UG Lounge Interior with Contents Overlay (image)** — Shows the modern interior of the UG Lounge with architectural elements; no humans are visible in this specific image.\n3. **NTU Smart Campus Icon Representation (image)** — A minimalist line-art icon of three stylized buildings; no human presence.\n4. **NTU_Smart_Campus_Sustainability_Icon (image)** — Symbolic icon of a building linked to a leaf; no human presence.\n5. **NTU Smart Campus Digital Interface Icon (image)** — Stylized computer monitor with digital interface elements; no human presence.\n6. **NTU Students Collaborating in Innovation Lab (image)** — Features seven diverse students using laptops and VR gear; includes human presence.\n7. **NTU Smart Campus Collaborative Learning Scene (image)** — Four students collaborating around a table with digital screens; includes human presence.\n8. **NTU Students Walking Together Across Disciplines (image)** — Three students walking and laughing in a corridor; includes human presence.\n9. **NTU Student Empowerment and Community Graphic (image)** — Depicts a joyful, diverse group of students; includes human presence.\n10. **NTU Students Gathering on Campus Lawn (image)** — Five students relaxing on a lawn; includes human presence.\n\n### Figures That Exclude Human Presence:\n\nThe following figures associated with the NTU Smart Campus do **not** include human presence:\n\n- **NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card (image)**\n- **NTU Smart Campus UG Lounge Interior with Contents Overlay (image)** — While it shows an interior space, no people are depicted.\n- **NTU Smart Campus Icon Representation (image)**\n- **NTU_Smart_Campus_Sustainability_Icon (image)**\n- **NTU Smart Campus Digital Interface Icon (image)**\n\nThese visuals focus on architecture, symbolic representation, or digital interfaces rather than human activity.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the context does not provide a direct mapping of figures to each of the “Top 10 Reasons,” several images and icons visually support the themes of the Smart Campus (e.g., sustainability, technology, collaboration, campus life). Among these, at least five figures explicitly exclude human presence, serving instead as conceptual or architectural representations of the campus environment.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] NTU Smart Campus Top 10 Reasons Title Card (image)\n- [2] NTU Smart Campus UG Lounge Interior with Contents Overlay (image)\n- [3] NTU Smart Campus Icon Representation (image)\n- [4] NTU_Smart_Campus_Sustainability_Icon (image)\n- [5] NTU Smart Campus Digital Interface Icon (image)",
