      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of Schools/Centers and Their Detail Status in CoHASS\n\nThe College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CoHASS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) comprises a total of **seven** academic units. These are:\n\n1. School of Art, Design and Media  \n2. School of Humanities  \n3. School of Social Sciences  \n4. Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information  \n5. Nanyang Centre for Public Administration  \n6. NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore  \n7. Centre for Liberal Arts and Social Sciences  \n\nAccording to the available materials, the first five units — namely, the School of Art, Design and Media; School of Humanities; School of Social Sciences; Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information; and Nanyang Centre for Public Administration — are each individually introduced in detail, including descriptions of their academic focus, mission, and sometimes rankings or achievements [rag-1][rag-2].\n\nIn contrast, the remaining two units — **NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore** and **Centre for Liberal Arts and Social Sciences** — are listed as part of CoHASS but are not described in detail within the provided context [rag-1][rag-2]. This indicates that while they are formally recognized as constituent parts of the college, no substantive information about their structure, programs, or research focus is included in the current documentation.\n\nTherefore, based on the explicit comparison between the total number of units and those with detailed introductions, we conclude that:\n\n> **Exactly 2 schools/centers from the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences are not individually introduced in detail.**\n\nThis result is directly supported by both RAG summaries, which consistently identify the same two centers as lacking detailed descriptions [rag-1][rag-2], and is further corroborated by the tool execution result that outputs “2” as the final count [tool-execution].\n\n---\n\nThe analysis in this step establishes the baseline for answering the user’s question: identifying which entities fall under CoHASS and determining how many lack individual elaboration. The next steps may explore whether additional sources provide details on the two unelaborated centers, but for now, the count stands at **2**.",
