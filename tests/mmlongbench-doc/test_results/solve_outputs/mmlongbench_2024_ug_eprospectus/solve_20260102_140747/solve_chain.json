According to the admissions brochure, NTU categorizes applicants based on their academic qualifications, each with a distinct application window [rag-1]. The key groups and their deadlines are as follows:\n\n- **Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level holders**: Deadline ends on **19 March 2024** [rag-1].  \n- **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma holders**: Deadline also ends on **19 March 2024** [rag-1].  \n- **Polytechnic diploma holders**: Deadline falls in **February 2024**, specifically earlier than March [rag-1].  \n- **NUS High School Diploma holders**: Deadline is in **January 2024** [rag-1].  \n- **Part-Time B.Eng and B.Tech applicants**: Deadline is **15 January 2024**, the earliest among the listed groups [rag-1].\n\nComparing these dates, the deadlines for GCE 'A' Level and IB Diploma applicants both occur on **19 March 2024**, which is later than all other groups. No other applicant group has a deadline beyond this date. Therefore, these two groups share the latest application deadline.\n\n### Summary  \nThe applicant groups with the latest end of application period are those holding the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level and the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, both with a deadline of 19 March 2024 [rag-1].",
