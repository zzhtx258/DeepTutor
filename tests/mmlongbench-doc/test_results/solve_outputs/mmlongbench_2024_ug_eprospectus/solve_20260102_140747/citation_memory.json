      "raw_result": "Nanyang Technological University (NTU) outlines distinct applicant groups and their corresponding application deadline end dates in its undergraduate admissions brochure, accommodating diverse academic backgrounds and pathways. These groups include holders of the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘A’ Level, polytechnic diplomas, the NUS High School Diploma, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, and participants in part-time or work-study degree programs.\n\nApplicants presenting the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘A’ Level certificate have an application window that begins upon the release of results and ends on **19 March 2024**. Similarly, applicants with the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma also have a deadline of **19 March 2024**, although their application period begins earlier on 1 December 2023. Those holding or expected to graduate with a relevant diploma from one of Singapore’s five polytechnics, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), LASALLE College of the Arts, the National Institute of Early Childhood Development, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Work-Study Diploma, BCA Academy, or the Singapore Sports School must apply between 1 February and **21 February 2024**. NUS High School Diploma applicants share the same start date as IB applicants (1 December 2023) but have an earlier end date of **20 January 2024**.\n\nNotably, applicants for Part-Time B.Eng and Part-Time B.Tech in Computing (a SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree) have the longest application window, running from 3 November 2023 to **15 January 2024**, reflecting NTU’s targeted support for adult and working learners under the Adult Learners Scheme. This extended period accommodates the non-traditional timelines of mature applicants.\n\nThese deadlines are structured to align with the academic calendars of each qualification type, ensuring equitable access across pathways. The application fee structure further differentiates applicant types: S$15 for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, S$25 for international applicants, and a higher fee of S$65 for Part-Time B.Eng and B.Tech applicants, likely due to additional administrative or assessment requirements associated with these programs.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2024.ug.eprospectus.pdf",
