## S1: Identification of Applicant Groups and Their Application Deadlines

To determine which applicant groups have the latest end of application period, we first extract and organize all relevant applicant categories and their corresponding deadlines from the provided knowledge base. According to the admissions brochure, NTU categorizes applicants based on their academic qualifications, each with a distinct application window [rag-1]. The key groups and their deadlines are as follows:

- **Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level holders**: Deadline ends on **19 March 2024** [rag-1].  
- **International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma holders**: Deadline also ends on **19 March 2024** [rag-1].  
- **Polytechnic diploma holders**: Deadline falls in **February 2024**, specifically earlier than March [rag-1].  
- **NUS High School Diploma holders**: Deadline is in **January 2024** [rag-1].  
- **Part-Time B.Eng and B.Tech applicants**: Deadline is **15 January 2024**, the earliest among the listed groups [rag-1].

Comparing these dates, the deadlines for GCE 'A' Level and IB Diploma applicants both occur on **19 March 2024**, which is later than all other groups. No other applicant group has a deadline beyond this date. Therefore, these two groups share the latest application deadline.

### Summary  
The applicant groups with the latest end of application period are those holding the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level and the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, both with a deadline of 19 March 2024 [rag-1].
