      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of NTU Colleges/Schools/Institutes Using Year 3 Students as Cover Page Models\n\nTo determine whether any colleges, schools, or institutes at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) explicitly use Year 3 students as cover page student models, we conducted a comprehensive review of available documentation, including promotional materials, prospectuses, and institutional branding references. The analysis was guided by the principle that any claim must be directly supported by explicit textual evidence from the provided materials.\n\n### Key Findings from Available Materials\n\nAcross all six RAG queries and their corresponding summaries, a consistent conclusion emerges: **there is no documented evidence** that any NTU college, school, or institute has selected or featured Year 3 students specifically as cover page models. The materials reference student imagery in general terms — such as “students engaged in interdisciplinary collaboration,” “campus life scenes,” or “program-specific portraits” — but none specify the academic year of the individuals depicted [rag-5].\n\nOne notable exception is the mention of **Gladys Phua Min**, a **Year 2 student** from the NTU-University Scholars Programme (NTU-USP), who is explicitly identified as being featured in promotional material [rag-4][rag-6]. This confirms that at least one program uses a Year 2 student for visual representation, but it does not extend to Year 3 students.\n\nAdditionally, while some documents reference testimonials or profiles of Year 3 students — such as Wang Shi Lin Nicole from the Nanyang Business School — these are presented in narrative or testimonial contexts, not as designated “cover page models” [rag-3]. There is no indication that these students were selected for visual marketing purposes on official covers or front pages.\n\n### Logical Derivation\n\nGiven the absence of any direct statement identifying Year 3 students as cover page models, and the presence of explicit references to Year 2 students in such roles, we can logically infer the following:\n\n- If Year 3 students were used as cover models, it would likely be mentioned in the context of program promotion or branding strategy — similar to how Gladys Phua Min’s role is documented.\n- The lack of such documentation across multiple search queries suggests either:\n  1. No NTU unit currently employs Year 3 students for this purpose, or\n  2. Such usage exists but is not publicly documented in the materials reviewed.\n\nHowever, under the strict evidentiary standard required — that conclusions must be based solely on available materials — we cannot assume undocumented practices. Therefore, the only defensible conclusion is that **no NTU college, school, or institute is explicitly documented as using Year 3 students as cover page student models**.\n\n### Summary\n\nBased on a thorough review of all available documentation, there is no evidence to support the claim that any NTU college, school, or institute uses Year 3 students as cover page student models. All referenced student imagery either involves Year 2 students or lacks specification of academic year. Until further documentation emerges, this remains the definitive conclusion based on current knowledge.",
