## S1: Analysis of NTU Colleges/Schools/Institutes Using Year 3 Students as Cover Page Models

To determine whether any colleges, schools, or institutes at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) explicitly use Year 3 students as cover page student models, we conducted a comprehensive review of available documentation, including promotional materials, prospectuses, and institutional branding references. The analysis was guided by the principle that any claim must be directly supported by explicit textual evidence from the provided materials.

### Key Findings from Available Materials

Across all six RAG queries and their corresponding summaries, a consistent conclusion emerges: **there is no documented evidence** that any NTU college, school, or institute has selected or featured Year 3 students specifically as cover page models. The materials reference student imagery in general terms — such as “students engaged in interdisciplinary collaboration,” “campus life scenes,” or “program-specific portraits” — but none specify the academic year of the individuals depicted [rag-5].

One notable exception is the mention of **Gladys Phua Min**, a **Year 2 student** from the NTU-University Scholars Programme (NTU-USP), who is explicitly identified as being featured in promotional material [rag-4][rag-6]. This confirms that at least one program uses a Year 2 student for visual representation, but it does not extend to Year 3 students.

Additionally, while some documents reference testimonials or profiles of Year 3 students — such as Wang Shi Lin Nicole from the Nanyang Business School — these are presented in narrative or testimonial contexts, not as designated “cover page models” [rag-3]. There is no indication that these students were selected for visual marketing purposes on official covers or front pages.

### Logical Derivation

Given the absence of any direct statement identifying Year 3 students as cover page models, and the presence of explicit references to Year 2 students in such roles, we can logically infer the following:

- If Year 3 students were used as cover models, it would likely be mentioned in the context of program promotion or branding strategy — similar to how Gladys Phua Min’s role is documented.
- The lack of such documentation across multiple search queries suggests either:
  1. No NTU unit currently employs Year 3 students for this purpose, or
  2. Such usage exists but is not publicly documented in the materials reviewed.

However, under the strict evidentiary standard required — that conclusions must be based solely on available materials — we cannot assume undocumented practices. Therefore, the only defensible conclusion is that **no NTU college, school, or institute is explicitly documented as using Year 3 students as cover page student models**.

### Summary

Based on a thorough review of all available documentation, there is no evidence to support the claim that any NTU college, school, or institute uses Year 3 students as cover page student models. All referenced student imagery either involves Year 2 students or lacks specification of academic year. Until further documentation emerges, this remains the definitive conclusion based on current knowledge.

    No explicit information is available confirming which NTU colleges, schools, or institutes have used Year 3 students as student models on their cover pages or promotional materials. While some documents mention Year 3 students like Wang Shi Lin Nicole (Nanyang Business School) in testimonials, and other students in promotional images, none specify that Year 3 students were selected specifically for cover page modeling. The context includes branding and visual marketing strategies across NTU schools but lacks grade-level representation details for cover imagery.

    ```
    No evidence found that Year 3 students are used as cover page models in NTU publications. The only explicitly mentioned student model is a Year 2 student from the NTU-University Scholars Programme (NTU-USP). Other images show NTU students in general campus settings without specifying academic year.

    No relevant information found for this query. The question may be Not answerable based on available documents. The provided context describes general student imagery used in NTU promotional materials (e.g., interdisciplinary collaboration, campus life, program-specific portraits), but does not mention Year 3 students being used as cover page models or any year-specific representation strategy for cover pages.

    No NTU college, school, or institute is explicitly mentioned as featuring Year 3 students as named models in their cover pages or promotional materials. The available references include Year 2 students (e.g., Gladys Phua Min from NTU-USP) and students from other programs (CNYSP, Renaissance Engineering, NTU-NIE TSP), but none are confirmed to be Year 3. Page references in documents do not specify student year levels in imagery.
