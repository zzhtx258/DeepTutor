The key groups and their respective application end dates are as follows:\n\n- **Singapore-Cambridge GCE A Level Applicants**: Application period ends on **19 March 2024**.\n- **NUS High School Diploma Applicants**: Deadline is **20 January 2024**.\n- **Polytechnic Diploma Holders**: Deadline is **21 February 2024**.\n- **Part-Time B.Eng Program Applicants**: Deadline is **15 January 2024**.\n- **IB Diploma Applicants**: No specific end date is provided in the available materials [rag-1].\n\nAmong these, the **Singapore-Cambridge GCE A Level Applicants** have the latest deadline at **19 March 2024**, which is later than all other specified groups. The IB Diploma Applicants cannot be compared definitively due to the absence of a stated deadline.\n\nThus, based strictly on the data available, the group with the latest application end date is the **Singapore-Cambridge GCE A Level Applicants**.\n\n### Summary\nThe Singapore-Cambridge GCE A Level Applicants hold the latest application deadline at 19 March 2024, surpassing all other applicant groups with explicitly stated deadlines. No conclusion can be drawn for IB Diploma Applicants due to missing data.",
