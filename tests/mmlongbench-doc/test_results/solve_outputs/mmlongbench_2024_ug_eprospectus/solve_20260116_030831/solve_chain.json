      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of the Tennis Photo in the Brochure\n\nThe tennis photo referenced in the brochure — identified as **NTU_Sports_Facilities_Icons** — is not a photograph of a real student engaged in tennis. Instead, it is a **symbolic, iconographic illustration** designed to represent sports facilities or activities at the institution [rag-1]. The image features a stylized **tennis ball** alongside other sports-related symbols, serving as a visual shorthand rather than a depiction of any individual student or their academic background.\n\nSince no actual student is portrayed in this image, it is not possible to associate the photo with any specific major. The purpose of the illustration is purely representational and institutional branding, not personal identification or academic categorization.\n\nTherefore, based on the available materials, **no student major is shown in the tennis photo**, as the image does not depict a real person at all.\n\n### Summary\nThe tennis photo in the brochure is an abstract icon, not a portrait of a student; hence, no academic major can be attributed to it.",
