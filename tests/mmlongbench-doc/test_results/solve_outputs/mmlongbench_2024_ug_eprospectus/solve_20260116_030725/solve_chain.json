      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Badminton Photo for Academic Major Identification\n\nThe objective of this step is to determine whether the badminton photograph in the brochure explicitly or implicitly identifies the academic major of the student depicted. Based on the available materials, we can conclude that **no academic major is associated with the student in the badminton photo**.\n\nThe image features a female athlete wearing a white and black jersey with red accents, actively participating in a varsity badminton match under NTU’s “Sports @ NTU” program [rag-1]. While the surrounding text emphasizes NTU’s commitment to holistic education and student engagement in athletics, it does not link this particular athlete to any specific academic discipline such as Medicine, Science, or Biological Science — majors which are referenced elsewhere in the brochure for students shown in other contexts [rag-1].\n\nFurthermore, no visual cues (such as departmental logos, course-related accessories, or textual overlays) appear in the image to suggest an affiliation with a particular major. The tool execution result corroborates this finding, stating unequivocally: “The badminton photo does not identify the student's academic major; no major is visually indicated or explicitly mentioned.”\n\nThus, based on both textual context and absence of visual indicators, we conclude that the badminton photo does not provide sufficient information to determine the student’s academic major.\n\nIn summary, while the image successfully conveys the student’s role as a varsity athlete at NTU, it intentionally or incidentally omits any reference to her field of study. Therefore, the question of which major the student belongs to remains unanswerable from this specific visual and textual context.",
