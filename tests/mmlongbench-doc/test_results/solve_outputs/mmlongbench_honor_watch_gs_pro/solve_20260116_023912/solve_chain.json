      "step_response": "## S1: Icon Color Identification for App Management on Honor Watch GS Pro\n\nTo address the user’s query regarding the colors of the icons used to move an app up and remove an app, we analyze the provided materials. According to the documentation for the **Honor Watch GS Pro**, users interact with two specific icons on the **Favorites Screen** to manage app positions and removals.\n\n### Icon for Moving an App Up\nThe icon used to move an app upward in the list is a **gray circular icon** featuring a **white upward-pointing arrow**. This design provides clear visual feedback while maintaining a neutral tone appropriate for reordering actions.  \n[cite_id=rag-1]\n\n### Icon for Removing an App\nThe icon used to remove an app is a **red circular icon** with a **white minus sign**. The use of red signals a destructive or irreversible action (removal), aligning with common UI/UX conventions that associate red with deletion or caution.  \n[cite_id=rag-1]\n\nThese color assignments are consistent across both the detailed summary and the raw excerpt from the knowledge base, confirming their accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the icon to move an app up is **gray**, and the icon to remove an app is **red** — each paired with a white symbol for contrast and clarity.  \n[cite_id=rag-1]",
