## S1: Analysis of Icon Color Information

In evaluating the query regarding the color of the icons that users touch to move the app down, it is essential to note that all attempts to retrieve specific details about this aspect have yielded no relevant findings. The available materials indicate that while the icons are described in terms of their functions, there is a significant lack of information regarding their color.

Specifically, the search results consistently reflect that the context does not specify the color of these icons on the HONOR Watch GS Pro. For instance, multiple queries returned summaries stating, "No relevant information found for this query," confirming that there is no explicit mention of the icon colors in the provided materials. This absence of detail suggests that while users may interact with these icons, their visual characteristics, particularly color, remain unspecified and unaddressed in the available documentation.

In conclusion, the analysis confirms that there is a notable gap in the information regarding the color of the icons that users touch to move the app down. This lack of detail may impact user experience, as color can play a significant role in user interface design and usability.
