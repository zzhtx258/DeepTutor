## S1: Identification of Distinct Button Functions During a Workout

During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, the physical button interactions are deliberately designed to provide intuitive, safe, and efficient control while minimizing accidental inputs—especially critical during high-intensity or water-based activities such as swimming [rag-1]. Based on the provided knowledge, there are exactly **four distinct button functions**, each defined by a unique press type (short press vs. long press) and assigned to one of the two side buttons (Up or Down).

These functions are as follows:

1. **Short press of the Up button**: This action serves a tri-functional purpose—it can **pause or end the current workout**, **lock the screen** to prevent unintended touches, or **adjust the volume of voice prompts**. The context-sensitive behavior ensures adaptability to user needs without requiring additional menu navigation [rag-1].

2. **Long press (press and hold) of the Up button**: This is a safety-critical function, specifically designed to **definitively end the workout session**. It is especially important in swim mode, where accidental touches are common due to water contact, and a deliberate, sustained action is required to terminate the session to avoid data loss or misrecording [rag-1].

3. **Short press of the Down button**: This function allows the user to **cycle through real-time data screens** during the workout. Each press advances the display to the next metric screen (e.g., heart rate, pace, calories, lap time), enabling quick access to key performance indicators without interrupting the activity [rag-1].

4. **Long press (press and hold) of the Down button**: This activates the **voice assistant**, allowing users to issue voice commands (e.g., “What’s my current pace?”) hands-free, which is particularly useful during running or cycling when physical interaction is inconvenient [rag-1].

These four functions represent the complete set of distinct, non-overlapping interactions available during a workout. No other button combinations or gestures are documented as functional in this mode, confirming that the system enforces a minimal, purpose-driven interface.

### Summary  
There are precisely four distinct button functions during a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, each associated with a specific combination of button (Up/Down) and press type (short/long), ensuring both usability and safety in fitness scenarios [rag-1].

    During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, there are four distinct button functions: pressing the Up button to pause/end the workout, lock the screen, or adjust voice prompt volume; pressing and holding the Up button to definitively end the workout (critical for swim mode); pressing the Down button to cycle through real-time data screens; and pressing and holding the Down button to activate the voice assistant.
