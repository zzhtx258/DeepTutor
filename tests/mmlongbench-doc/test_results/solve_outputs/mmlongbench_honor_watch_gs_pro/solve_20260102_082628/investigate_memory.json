      "raw_result": "During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, the button functions are specifically tailored to support fitness activities while minimizing unintended interactions. The Up and Down buttons have distinct roles that differ from their standard non-workout functions:\n\n- **Press the Up button**: During a workout, pressing the Up button allows the user to pause or end the workout session, lock the screen, or adjust the volume of voice prompts (such as those from Smart Companion). This button serves as a primary control for managing the workout in real time.\n\n- **Press and hold the Up button**: This action is used to definitively end a workout session. It acts as a confirmation step to prevent accidental termination, especially during high-intensity activities. This function is particularly important during swim workouts, where the screen is locked by default and cannot be unlocked — the only way to end the session is by pressing and holding the Up button.\n\n- **Press the Down button**: While in workout mode, pressing the Down button switches between different data screens to view real-time metrics such as heart rate, pace, distance, time, steps, cadence, total calories, and total climbing. This enables quick access to performance data without needing to navigate menus.\n\n- **Press and hold the Down button**: This gesture wakes up the voice assistant, a feature exclusive to the HONOR Watch GS Pro. It allows users to issue voice commands during workouts without touching the screen, enhancing convenience and safety during physical activity.\n\nThese functions are optimized for one-handed, glanceable control during exercise, ensuring users can interact with their watch efficiently while maintaining focus on their workout. Additionally, the screen remains locked during swim workouts, and only the press-and-hold Up button can terminate the session, reinforcing safety in aquatic environments.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] honor_watch_gs_pro.pdf",
      "summary": "During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, there are four distinct button functions: pressing the Up button to pause/end the workout, lock the screen, or adjust voice prompt volume; pressing and holding the Up button to definitively end the workout (critical for swim mode); pressing the Down button to cycle through real-time data screens; and pressing and holding the Down button to activate the voice assistant.",
