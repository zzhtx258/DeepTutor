## S1: Time Displayed on Gallery Screenshot for Setting Watch Faces

The gallery screenshot that demonstrates how to set Gallery Watch Faces displays the time **10:08 AM**. This time is visually overlaid on the watch face preview within the Huawei Health App’s Gallery screen, serving as part of the user interface guidance for customizing smartwatch displays [rag-1].

This specific time is not arbitrary — it is commonly used in watch and clock product photography and UI previews because the hands at 10:08 create a symmetrical, aesthetically pleasing “smile” shape around the brand logo (typically placed at the 12 o’clock position), while also ensuring all dial elements remain clearly visible without obstruction.

Since no image files were generated or provided in this step, we rely solely on textual evidence from the knowledge base to confirm the displayed time.

In summary, the time shown in the relevant gallery screenshot is definitively **10:08 AM**, as explicitly stated in the available materials.
