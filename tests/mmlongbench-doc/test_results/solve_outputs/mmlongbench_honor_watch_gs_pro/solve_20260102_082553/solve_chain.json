      "step_response": "## S1: Assessing Answerability of the Icon Color Query\n\nThe user asks for the color of icons used to move apps down on a mobile device. To address this, we must first determine whether the available knowledge sources contain relevant information about mobile application user interface (UI) elements—specifically, gesture-related icons and their visual properties such as color.\n\nThe provided knowledge base materials [rag-1] and [rag-2] explicitly state that all referenced content is confined to the HONOR Watch GS Pro smartwatch’s interface [rag-1][rag-2]. These documents describe watch-specific gestures (e.g., swiping up/down/left/right for navigation or viewing notifications), button functions, and watch face customization—but they make no mention of mobile app interfaces, app manipulation gestures, or the visual design of icons used in smartphone operating systems [rag-1][rag-2].\n\nFurthermore, no tool execution results or external data sources were retrieved to supplement this information, and no images or visual artifacts are available to infer icon colors from UI screenshots or design guidelines.\n\nTherefore, based on the principle of evidence-based reasoning, the question regarding the color of icons used to move apps down is **not answerable** with the current knowledge base. The scope of available information is fundamentally misaligned with the domain of mobile app UI design, which falls outside the scope of smartwatch interface documentation.\n\nIn summary, the available materials do not contain any data about mobile app gesture icons or their color schemes, rendering the user’s query unanswerable under the current constraints.",
