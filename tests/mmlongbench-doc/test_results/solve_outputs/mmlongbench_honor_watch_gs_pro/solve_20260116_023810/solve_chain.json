This system enables users to monitor their real-time exertion levels during exercise with intuitive color cues.\n\nAccording to the provided documentation, the **aerobic zone** — which corresponds to moderate-intensity cardiovascular activity — is specifically indicated by a **yellow banner** within this ring [rag-1]. The full color mapping for reference is as follows:\n\n- **Green**: Fatburning zone  \n- **Yellow**: Aerobic zone  \n- **Orange**: Anaerobic zone  \n- **Red**: Extreme zone  \n\nThis visual design allows for immediate recognition of training intensity without needing to interpret numerical heart rate values, enhancing usability during physical activity.\n\nIn summary, the color representing the aerobic zone on the Honor Watch GS Pro is **yellow**, as explicitly stated in the device’s user interface documentation [rag-1].",
