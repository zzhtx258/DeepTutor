This color-coded segment is part of the **Heart Rate Zone Ring**, which encircles the dial and uses different colors to represent various intensity levels:\n\n- **Green**: Fatburning Zone\n- **Yellow**: Aerobic Zone\n- **Orange**: Anaerobic Zone\n- **Red**: Extreme Zone\n\nDuring an outdoor run, for example, if your heart rate falls within the aerobic range (e.g., 146 bpm), the watch will display a yellow banner and highlight the corresponding segment on the ring to indicate you are in the moderate-intensity aerobic zone.\n\nThis visual cue helps users monitor their workout intensity in real time without needing to interpret numerical values alone.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Honor_Watch_GS_Pro_Outdoor_Run_Heart_Rate_Display (image)\n- [2] Aerobic Heart Rate Zone\n- [3] Heart Rate Zone Ring\n- [4] Honor Watch GS Pro\n- [5] HONOR Watch GS Pro Gesture Operations Table (table)",
