      "raw_result": "The setup of Gallery watch faces on the HONOR Watch GS Pro involves customizing the display of time and date elements after uploading a personal image via the Huawei Health app. According to the provided context, once a still image is uploaded through the Gallery feature in the Huawei Health app, users can further personalize the watch face by adjusting the **time and date display**.\n\nOn the Gallery screen within the app, users can select the **\"Style\"** option to customize the font and color of the time and date text. Available color options for the time and date include white, black, red, blue, and green. Additionally, the **\"Layout\"** option allows users to adjust the positioning of the time and date elements on the watch face. These adjustments are reflected directly on the watch’s display, which shows the time in a digital format (e.g., \"10:42\") and the date (e.g., \"23 Apr\") overlaid on the uploaded image.\n\nThe watch face interface, as illustrated in the visual analysis, displays the time in a clean, sans-serif font with high contrast against the photographic background. The time is typically positioned near the bottom center of the screen, with the date directly beneath it. The time format follows a 24-hour digital display (e.g., \"14:37\"), consistent with the device's default UI design language. The uploaded image serves as the background, while the time and date remain clearly legible due to the customizable font color and positioning.\n\nThis functionality requires the Huawei Health app to be updated to version 10.0.0.633 or above and the watch firmware to version 1.0.1.16 or above. Only still images can be used, and up to 20 images can be transferred and cycled through by tapping the watch screen.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] honor_watch_gs_pro.pdf",
