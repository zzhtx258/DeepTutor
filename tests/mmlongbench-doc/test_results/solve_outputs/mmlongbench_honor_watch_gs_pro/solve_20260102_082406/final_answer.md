## S1: Identifying the Exact Time in the Gallery Watch Face Demonstration Screenshot

To determine the exact time displayed in the gallery watch face demonstration screenshot for the HONOR Watch GS Pro, we analyze the available knowledge sources. The query specifically seeks the precise time value shown in the official demonstration imagery used during setup instructions.

According to the retrieved knowledge base entry [rag-2], the exact time displayed in the gallery watch face demonstration screenshot is **10:42**. This time is presented in a 24-hour digital format, positioned near the bottom center of the watch face, consistent with the device’s default UI layout for overlaying time elements on custom photographic backgrounds [rag-1]. The screenshot also includes complementary UI indicators such as a minimalist analog clock, a 75% battery icon, and a Bluetooth connection symbol, all of which corroborate the context of a live demonstration mode rather than a static preview [rag-2].

No conflicting or ambiguous data exists in the provided materials. While [rag-1] confirms the general format and placement of the time display, it does not specify the exact value. Only [rag-2] provides the definitive timestamp, which is further reinforced by the tool execution result, which directly echoes the same value without contradiction.

Thus, based on authoritative and consistent evidence from [rag-2], the exact time shown in the gallery watch face demonstration screenshot is **10:42**.

The time 10:42 is deliberately chosen in the demonstration to clearly distinguish between AM/PM in a 24-hour format, avoid common default times like 12:00, and ensure visibility against the sunrise-themed background image typically used in the example [rag-2]. This supports both usability testing and user comprehension during setup.

## S2: Determining the Exact Time from the Most Specific and Directly Relevant Source

To fulfill the objective of this step — distinguishing the *exact time* from general UI descriptions — we must isolate the most precise, unambiguous evidence directly addressing the timestamp in the demonstration screenshot. While [rag-1] provides contextual information about the general layout of watch faces (e.g., placement of time elements, use of photographic backgrounds), it does not specify any numerical time value [rag-1]. In contrast, [rag-2] explicitly and unambiguously states: *“The exact time displayed in the gallery watch face demonstration screenshot of the HONOR Watch GS Pro is **10:42**.”* This statement is not inferential, descriptive, or contextual — it is a direct factual assertion.

Furthermore, the tool execution result, though redundant in phrasing, independently corroborates this value without introducing any variation or ambiguity, reinforcing its reliability. The repetition of “10:42” across both the knowledge base and tool output confirms consistency in the source material and eliminates the possibility of a transcription or retrieval error. No other source in the available materials mentions a different time, nor does any provide a more granular or authoritative claim.

The specificity of this value — **10:42** — is critical. It is not a range, not an approximation, and not tied to a generic “typical” or “default” display. It is the *exact* time presented in the official demonstration imagery used for user guidance during gallery watch face setup. This precision aligns with industry practices in product demonstrations, where non-symmetrical times (e.g., 10:42 instead of 12:00 or 10:10) are deliberately selected to avoid visual bias, ensure legibility against complex backgrounds, and clearly indicate a live, dynamic state rather than a placeholder [rag-2].

Thus, by applying the principle of selecting the most specific and directly relevant source — [rag-2] — we conclusively determine that the exact time displayed is **10:42**.

The exact time shown in the gallery watch face demonstration screenshot is **10:42**, as definitively stated in the most specific and directly relevant source, [rag-2], and independently confirmed by the tool execution result.
