This situation typically arises if the measurement was taken at an inappropriate time or in an unsuitable environment. To obtain an accurate measurement, it is essential to measure your resting heart rate in a quiet and relaxed environment when you are awake. \n\nThe best time to capture your resting heart rate is immediately after waking up in the morning. Therefore, if the watch fails to show a reading, it may imply that the conditions were not favorable for an accurate assessment, such as being in a noisy or stressful environment or not being calm and still during the measurement process. \n\nEnsuring that continuous heart rate monitoring is enabled in the Huawei Health app can also help to maintain accurate resting heart rate readings when conditions are appropriate.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] honor_watch_gs_pro.pdf",

      "query": "environment conditions for accurate heart rate measurement",
      "raw_result": "To ensure accurate heart rate measurement while using the HONOR Watch GS Pro, it’s crucial to consider the following environmental and usage conditions:\n\n1. **Wearing the Watch Correctly**: The watch should be worn correctly on the wrist, positioned above the wrist joint without being too loose or too tight. This ensures that the optical heart rate sensor can maintain direct contact with the skin.\n\n2. **Maintaining Stillness**: During heart rate measurement, it's important to keep the arm still. Movements can interfere with the accuracy of the reading.\n\n3. **Environment Factors**: The watch is designed to measure heart rate continuously. It can utilize non-visible light to measure heart rate during sleep to minimize disturbances. Thus, ensuring that external light or significant noise does not interfere with the sensing during these measurements can help maintain accuracy.\n\n4. **Optimal Timing**: For resting heart rate measurements, it is best to take these readings in a calm and relaxed environment, typically right after waking up in the morning. \n\n5. **Continuous Monitoring Setup**: If you're using continuous heart rate monitoring, ensure this feature is enabled in the Huawei Health app. The measurement settings should also be adjusted to monitor heart rate effectively based on your activity level.\n\n6. **Avoiding Interference**: Ensure that there are no obstructions between the watch's sensor and your skin, as they can hinder measurement accuracy. \n\nBy following these guidelines, users can achieve optimal conditions for obtaining accurate heart rate readings from the HONOR Watch GS Pro.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] honor_watch_gs_pro.pdf",
