      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Resting Heart Rate Reading of '--'\n\nA resting heart rate reading of '--' on the HONOR Watch GS Pro signifies that the device was unable to capture the heart rate measurement. This situation typically arises due to inappropriate environmental conditions or timing when the measurement was taken. \n\nTo ensure accurate heart rate readings, it is crucial for users to be in a calm and relaxed environment. The optimal time for taking this measurement is ideally right after waking up in the morning, as this is when the body is at rest and least influenced by external factors. \n\nSeveral conditions can hinder the accuracy of heart rate readings, including:\n\n1. **Noise**: Loud sounds or disturbances can distract the user and affect the measurement process.\n2. **Stress**: Emotional or physical stress can elevate heart rates, leading to inaccurate readings.\n3. **Movement**: Any form of physical activity or movement during the measurement can prevent the watch from obtaining a stable reading.\n\nAdditionally, proper usage of the watch is essential. Users should ensure that the watch is worn correctly on the wrist, positioned above the wrist joint without being too loose or too tight. Keeping the arm still during the measurement is also critical for the sensor's accuracy.\n\nIn summary, to achieve a valid resting heart rate reading, users should remain in a quiet, relaxed environment, ideally right after waking up, while also adhering to proper usage guidelines for the watch.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Ideal Environmental Conditions for Accurate Heart Rate Measurement\n\nTo achieve an accurate heart rate measurement when the HONOR Watch GS Pro displays a resting heart rate reading of '--', it is essential to consider the environmental conditions in which the measurement is taken. The following factors are crucial for ensuring the watch can effectively capture the heart rate:\n\n1. **Calm and Relaxed Environment**: Users should find a quiet space free from distractions. A serene atmosphere minimizes external stimuli that could interfere with the heart rate sensor's functionality.\n\n2. **Timing of Measurement**: The optimal time to take a resting heart rate measurement is ideally right after waking up in the morning. At this time, the body is in a natural state of rest, making it less susceptible to fluctuations caused by daily activities.\n\n3. **Minimizing External Interference**: It is important to avoid any sources of noise or light that could disrupt the measurement process. Loud sounds or bright lights can distract the user and potentially affect the accuracy of the reading.\n\n4. **Physical Stability**: During the measurement, the user should remain still. Any movement can lead to inaccuracies, as the sensor relies on a stable position to obtain a clear reading.\n\n5. **Proper Watch Fit**: The watch must be worn correctly on the wrist, positioned above the wrist joint, and secured without being too loose or too tight. This ensures that the sensor can make proper contact with the skin for accurate readings.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, users can create an ideal environment for obtaining reliable heart rate measurements, thus ensuring that the HONOR Watch GS Pro functions optimally.",
