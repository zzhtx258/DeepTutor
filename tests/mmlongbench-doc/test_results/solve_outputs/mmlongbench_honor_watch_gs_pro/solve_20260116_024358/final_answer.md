## S1: Interpretation of '--' in Resting Heart Rate Display and Recommended Environment

The symbol "--" displayed as a resting heart rate reading does not have a documented, explicit definition within the available materials. Multiple searches across the knowledge base confirm that no official explanation is provided for this specific display behavior on devices such as the Honor Watch GS Pro or other compatible Huawei/Honor smartwatches [rag-1][rag-2][rag-4][rag-6]. Furthermore, there is no direct linkage between the appearance of "--" and any prescribed environmental condition or corrective action.

However, based on general device operation principles and contextual guidance for accurate resting heart rate measurement, we can infer the following:

- The "--" symbol likely indicates that the device was unable to obtain a valid heart rate reading at that moment.
- Common causes for such failure include:
  - Improper wear of the device (e.g., too loose or incorrectly positioned on the wrist)
  - Excessive movement during measurement
  - Sensor interference (e.g., dirt, moisture, or skin contact issues)
  - Low battery or software glitches

While no environment is specifically recommended *for the case when "--" appears*, best practices for obtaining an accurate resting heart rate — which may help avoid or resolve the "--" display — include:

> Being in a **quiet, relaxed state upon waking**, with **minimal movement** and the **device worn correctly** on the wrist [rag-3].

This suggests that if "--" appears, the user should:
1. Ensure the watch is snugly but comfortably fitted on the wrist.
2. Remain still and calm, ideally while seated or lying down.
3. Avoid measuring immediately after physical activity or stress.
4. Clean the sensor area and ensure good skin contact.

In summary, although the exact meaning of "--" is not defined in documentation, it functions as an indicator of measurement failure. The recommended environment to address or prevent this issue aligns with standard conditions for accurate resting heart rate capture: quiet, relaxed, motionless, and with proper device placement.

    The raw result does not explain what '--' means when displayed as the resting heart rate reading. However, it notes that resting heart rate should be measured in a quiet, relaxed state upon waking, with the device worn correctly and minimal movement for accuracy. No specific environment is linked to the '--' symbol, and no direct explanation of this display is provided.
