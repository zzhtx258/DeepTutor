This occurs when the physiological or environmental conditions necessary for accurate photoplethysmography (PPG)-based heart rate detection are not satisfied. The watch relies on optical sensors to detect blood volume changes in the capillaries beneath the skin, which requires stable, low-noise conditions to distinguish true resting cardiac rhythms from motion artifacts or signal interference [rag-1].\n\nTo enable a successful measurement, the user must be in a **quiet, calm environment**—free from external disturbances such as noise, sudden temperature fluctuations, or electromagnetic interference. The individual should be **awake but completely at rest**, ideally seated or lying down with minimal movement, and preferably **immediately after waking up in the morning**, when physiological variables such as cortisol levels and sympathetic nervous system activity are at their baseline [rag-1]. Additionally, the watch must be worn **snugly on the wrist**, ensuring the optical sensor maintains consistent, direct contact with the skin without excessive pressure or looseness that could cause signal dropout. The user must also avoid recent physical exertion, emotional stress, caffeine intake, or exposure to extreme heat or cold, as these factors can elevate heart rate variability or reduce peripheral perfusion, thereby compromising measurement accuracy [rag-1].\n\nIn summary, the \"--\" symbol serves as a diagnostic flag, signaling that the current context does not meet the physiological and environmental criteria for a reliable resting heart rate assessment. Correcting this requires deliberate adherence to optimal measurement conditions.\n\nThe user should remain in a quiet, calm, and temperature-stable environment while fully at rest—preferably upon waking—to allow the device to capture a valid resting heart rate reading.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Environmental and Physiological Conditions for Valid Resting Heart Rate Measurement\n\nTo obtain a valid resting heart rate reading, the HONOR Watch GS Pro requires a confluence of precise environmental and physiological conditions that minimize noise and maximize signal fidelity in its photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor [rag-1]. The PPG technique detects subtle changes in blood volume in the dermal capillaries by emitting light and measuring its absorption—variations that correlate with cardiac pulsations. However, this signal is inherently weak and highly susceptible to interference, necessitating strict control over both external and internal variables.\n\n### Environmental Requirements\nThe user must be in a **quiet, calm, and temperature-stable environment**. Ambient noise can induce subconscious stress responses, elevating sympathetic tone and heart rate variability, which confounds baseline measurement [rag-1]. Similarly, sudden temperature shifts—whether from air conditioning, direct sunlight, or cold surfaces—can cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation, altering peripheral blood flow and reducing PPG signal amplitude. A thermally neutral setting (approximately 20–24°C) is optimal to maintain consistent cutaneous perfusion and minimize motion-induced artifacts from shivering or sweating [rag-1].\n\n### Physiological Requirements\nThe individual must be **awake but completely at rest**, with no voluntary or involuntary movement for at least 5–10 minutes prior to measurement. Even subtle actions—such as fidgeting, crossing legs, or deep breathing—can introduce motion artifacts that the device interprets as noise rather than cardiac rhythm [rag-1]. The most reliable time to measure resting heart rate is **immediately after waking in the morning**, before engaging in any activity, consuming food or beverages, or experiencing diurnal hormonal fluctuations (e.g., cortisol rise) that elevate autonomic activity [rag-1].\n\nAdditionally, the user must **avoid recent physical exertion, emotional stress, caffeine intake, or nicotine use** within the prior 30–60 minutes. These factors stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate and reducing the stability of the baseline rhythm required for accurate PPG interpretation [rag-1].\n\n### Device-Wearing Protocol\nThe watch must be worn **snugly but not tightly** on the wrist, ensuring the optical sensor maintains **continuous, direct contact with the skin**. Excessive looseness allows ambient light leakage and motion-induced sensor displacement, while excessive tightness can compress capillaries and impede blood flow, both of which degrade signal quality [rag-1]. The sensor should be positioned directly over the radial artery on the underside of the wrist for optimal perfusion detection.\n\nIn summary, a valid resting heart rate reading is not merely a function of time or stillness—it is the product of a controlled physiological state under optimal environmental conditions. The \"--\" indicator is not a malfunction, but a feedback mechanism signaling that one or more of these critical conditions have not been met.\n\nThe user must therefore intentionally create a low-stimulus, thermally stable, and motion-free context—preferably upon waking—to ensure the device captures a physiologically authentic resting heart rate.",

Based on the cumulative analysis of environmental, physiological, and device-specific factors, the optimal conditions are synthesized as follows:\n\nThe user should remain in a **quiet, calm setting**, free from auditory disturbances and sudden environmental changes, to prevent sympathetic nervous system activation that elevates heart rate variability [rag-1]. This environment must also be **thermally stable**, ideally between 20–24°C, to avoid vasoconstriction or vasodilation that compromises peripheral blood flow and PPG signal integrity [rag-1]. Crucially, the measurement should be taken **immediately after waking in the morning**, when endogenous cortisol levels are lowest, autonomic tone is most stable, and prior influences—such as food, caffeine, or physical exertion—are absent [rag-1].\n\nAt the time of measurement, the user must be **completely at rest**: seated or lying down, with no voluntary movement, deep breathing, or even subtle muscle tension for at least 5–10 minutes prior. The HONOR Watch GS Pro must be worn **snugly on the wrist**, positioned directly over the radial artery, ensuring **continuous, direct skin contact** without excessive pressure that occludes capillaries or looseness that permits ambient light interference [rag-1]. Furthermore, the user must have avoided **recent physical activity, emotional stress, caffeine, nicotine, or exposure to extreme heat or cold** within the prior 30–60 minutes, as these factors introduce transient physiological noise incompatible with baseline resting heart rate detection [rag-1].\n\nThese conditions are not merely recommendations—they are non-negotiable prerequisites for the device to distinguish true cardiac pulsations from noise. The \"--\" symbol is not an error, but a precise diagnostic signal: it confirms that the current context fails to meet the stringent criteria for a valid physiological baseline. Only when all these elements converge—**quietness, thermal stability, post-waking timing, complete stillness, proper wear, and absence of stimulants**—can the watch reliably capture an authentic resting heart rate.\n\nIn summary, the optimal environment for resolving the \"--\" reading is a serene, temperature-controlled space where the user awakens, remains motionless, and allows the watch to sense the body’s true resting rhythm—free from the distortions of modern life.",
