      "raw_result": "When the HONOR Watch GS Pro displays \"--\" as the resting heart rate reading, it indicates that the watch was unable to measure your resting heart rate accurately. This typically occurs when the environmental or physiological conditions for a valid resting heart rate measurement are not met.\n\nTo obtain an accurate resting heart rate reading, the watch requires you to be in a quiet and relaxed environment while awake. The best time to measure resting heart rate is immediately after waking up in the morning, when your body is at its most physiologically stable state. If the measurement is taken at an inappropriate time — such as after physical activity, during stress, or in an environment with excessive movement or disturbance — the watch may fail to register a valid value.\n\nAdditionally, accurate measurement depends on proper watch placement: the device must be worn snugly but comfortably on the top of the wrist, with the sensor in direct contact with the skin. Environmental factors such as extreme temperatures, poor sensor contact due to loose fitting, or recent physical exertion can also interfere with the measurement.\n\nTo resolve this issue, ensure that:\n- You are awake and completely at rest.\n- You are in a calm, quiet setting with minimal movement.\n- The watch is worn correctly and securely on your wrist.\n- You initiate the measurement immediately upon waking, before getting out of bed or engaging in any activity.\n\nEnabling Continuous heart rate monitoring in the Huawei Health app may also improve the accuracy and consistency of resting heart rate detection over time.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] honor_watch_gs_pro.pdf",

To resolve this, the user should stay in a quiet, calm environment while awake and completely at rest, ideally immediately after waking up in the morning.
