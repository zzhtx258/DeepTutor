## S1: Analysis of Dedicated "Move Down" Icon and Its Color on Honor Watch GS Pro

Based on a comprehensive review of all available documentation and tool outputs, there is **no dedicated icon** specifically designed for moving an app *down* in the Favorites list on the Honor Watch GS Pro. This conclusion is consistently supported across multiple independent queries and summaries from the knowledge base.

The interface provides two primary interactive icons for managing apps in the Favorites list:
- A **gray circular icon with a white upward-pointing arrow** (`↑`) — used to move an app *up* in the list [rag-1][rag-3].
- A **red circular icon with a white minus sign** (`−`) — used to remove an app from the list [rag-1][rag-3].

Since no “move down” icon exists as a standalone UI element, it follows that **no color can be assigned** to such an icon. The functionality of reordering apps downward is likely achieved indirectly — for example, by moving other apps *up* around the target app, thereby shifting its position lower in the list [rag-3].

This design choice reflects a common UI pattern where directional actions (like up/down) are implemented asymmetrically when space or interaction simplicity is prioritized. In this case, only the “move up” action is explicitly exposed via a dedicated icon.

### Summary
There is no dedicated icon for moving an app down on the Honor Watch GS Pro; therefore, no color is associated with such an icon. Users must rely on moving other apps up to achieve a downward repositioning effect.
