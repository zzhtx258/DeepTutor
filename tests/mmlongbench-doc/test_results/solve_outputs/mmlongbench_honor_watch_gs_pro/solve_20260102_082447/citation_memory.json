      "raw_result": "The HONOR Watch GS Pro uses color-coded visual indicators to represent heart rate zones during workouts, including the aerobic zone. The watch displays a circular heart rate gauge with a segmented color gradient that corresponds to different intensity levels. Specifically, the aerobic zone is represented by the **orange** color segment, which indicates high-intensity activity. This is part of a broader system where green signifies low intensity, yellow indicates moderate intensity, orange corresponds to high intensity (aerobic zone), and red denotes very high intensity.\n\nThese color zones are designed to provide immediate, at-a-glance feedback during exercise without requiring user interaction. The watch automatically applies these color codes based on the selected heart rate zone calculation method—either Maximum Heart Rate percentage or Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) percentage. For most running activities, the HRR percentage method is used by default, calculating zones relative to the user’s heart rate reserve (HRmax – HRrest) plus resting heart rate.\n\nDuring a workout, users can swipe on the watch screen to view real-time heart rate and corresponding zone colors. After completing the workout, the summary screen displays average heart rate, maximum heart rate, and time spent in each color-coded zone, including the aerobic (orange) zone.\n\nThis color scheme aligns with Huawei/HONOR’s health monitoring interface guidelines and is consistent across fitness-oriented watch faces, ensuring intuitive interpretation of physiological exertion levels.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] honor_watch_gs_pro.pdf",
