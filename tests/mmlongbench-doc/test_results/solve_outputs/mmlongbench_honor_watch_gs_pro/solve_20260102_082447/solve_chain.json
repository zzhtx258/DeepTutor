      "step_response": "## S1: Identifying the Color Coding for the Aerobic Zone on Fitness Watches\n\nHeart rate zones on fitness watches are typically represented using a standardized color-coding system to help users intuitively understand exercise intensity levels in real time. According to the available knowledge, the HONOR Watch GS Pro employs a four-tiered color scheme to delineate heart rate intensity zones during physical activity [rag-1]. These zones are calculated based on either Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) or Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) percentages, ensuring personalized and accurate feedback [rag-1].\n\nWithin this system, each color corresponds to a specific physiological intensity range:\n- **Green** indicates the *low-intensity* zone, suitable for warm-ups or recovery.\n- **Yellow** represents the *moderate-intensity* zone, often associated with fat-burning activity.\n- **Orange** is designated for the *aerobic zone*, which corresponds to high-intensity efforts that improve cardiovascular endurance and lung capacity [rag-1].\n- **Red** signifies the *very high-intensity* zone, typically reserved for anaerobic training or maximal effort intervals.\n\nThe aerobic zone, specifically, is visually highlighted in **orange** on the HONOR Watch GS Pro’s circular heart rate gauge, providing immediate visual feedback to the user when their heart rate falls within this optimal training range [rag-1]. This color assignment aligns with industry conventions where warmer tones (orange, red) denote higher exertion levels, facilitating quick recognition without requiring numerical interpretation.\n\nIn summary, the color used to indicate the aerobic zone on the HONOR Watch GS Pro is **orange**, as explicitly defined by its heart rate zone color coding system [rag-1].",
