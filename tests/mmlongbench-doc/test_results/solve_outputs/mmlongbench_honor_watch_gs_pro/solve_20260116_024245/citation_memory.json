      "raw_result": "During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, the device provides specific button functions designed to enhance user control and convenience while exercising. These functions are primarily mapped to the **Up Button** and the **Down Button**, with distinct behaviors depending on whether the button is pressed or pressed-and-held.\n\n### Up Button Functions During Workout:\n- **Ending or Finishing a Workout**: A single press of the Up Button allows users to end or finish their current workout session.\n- **Completing a Workout**: Pressing and holding the Up Button completes the workout, likely finalizing data recording and saving metrics.\n- **Lock/Unlock Screen**: The Up Button also serves as a quick method to lock or unlock the screen during workouts — a unique feature of the HONOR Watch GS Pro compared to other models that may require a press-and-hold gesture for screen locking.\n\n### Down Button Functions During Workout:\n- **Screen Switching**: Pressing the Down Button switches between different data screens during a workout, allowing users to view metrics such as heart rate, pace, distance, elapsed time, and current local time without navigating menus.\n- **Voice Assistant Activation (if held)**: Although not explicitly stated for workout mode, pressing and holding the Down Button typically wakes up the voice assistant — this function may be contextually available even during workouts depending on system settings.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- In certain specialized workout modes like **Triathlon Mode**, there is no Settings icon available, and users must press the Down Button to move to the next form or segment.\n- For **Swim Workout**, the screen is locked by default and cannot be unlocked during the activity, which overrides standard button functionality for safety and waterproof integrity.\n- During any workout, notifications are suppressed to avoid distractions, aligning with the device’s focus on uninterrupted physical activity tracking.\n\nThese button operations are documented in the **HONOR Watch GS Pro Button Operation Reference Table** and supported by Section 1.6 (“Buttons and Gestures”) of the manual, ensuring intuitive, tactile control during active sessions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] HONOR Watch GS Pro Button Operation Reference Table (table)\n- [2] HONOR Watch GS Pro Gesture Operations Table (table)\n- [3] Section 1.6\n- [4] Up Button Function Reference Table (table)\n- [5] Workout Mode",

      "content": "During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, there are two primary buttons — Up and Down — each with distinct functions. The Up Button allows ending or finishing a workout with a single press, completing it with a long press, and locking/unlocking the screen. The Down Button switches between data screens during workouts and may activate the voice assistant if held. In specialized modes like Triathlon, the Down Button advances to the next segment; in Swim mode, the screen is locked by default. These functions are documented in the device’s button operation reference and Section 1.6 of the manual.",
