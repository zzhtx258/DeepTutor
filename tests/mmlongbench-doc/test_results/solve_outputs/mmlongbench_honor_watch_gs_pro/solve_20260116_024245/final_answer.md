## S1: Enumeration of Distinct Button Functions During a Workout

During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, user interaction is facilitated through two physical buttons — the **Up Button** and the **Down Button** — each supporting multiple context-sensitive functions. These functions are explicitly documented in the device’s operational reference and Section 1.6 of the manual [rag-1]. Below is a complete enumeration of all distinct button functions available during a workout session.

### Up Button Functions
The Up Button provides three distinct operational modes during workouts:
1. **Single press**: Ends or finishes the current workout.
2. **Long press**: Completes the workout (likely finalizing data logging and saving).
3. **Lock/Unlock screen**: Toggles screen lock state to prevent accidental inputs during exercise.

### Down Button Functions
The Down Button supports four distinct behaviors depending on workout context:
1. **Switch between data screens**: Cycles through different metric displays (e.g., heart rate, pace, distance) during active workouts.
2. **Activate voice assistant**: Triggered by holding the button (functionality may vary by firmware or region).
3. **Advance to next segment (Triathlon mode only)**: Progresses from one discipline (e.g., swim → bike) to the next without stopping the timer.
4. **Screen lock default (Swim mode only)**: The screen is automatically locked to prevent water-triggered inputs; this is a passive function tied to mode selection rather than direct button action.

> **Note**: While “screen lock” appears under both buttons, it represents different contexts — the Up Button actively toggles lock/unlock, while the Down Button’s role in Swim mode reflects a system-enforced default behavior, not an interactive function.

### Total Count of Distinct Functions
Counting each unique action as a separate function (even if mapped to the same button), we identify:

- **Up Button**: 3 distinct functions
- **Down Button**: 4 distinct functions

Thus, there are **7 distinct button functions** available during a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro.

This enumeration is derived directly from the documented behaviors in the provided materials [rag-1], ensuring accuracy and completeness based on available specifications.

    During a workout on the HONOR Watch GS Pro, there are two primary buttons — Up and Down — each with distinct functions. The Up Button allows ending or finishing a workout with a single press, completing it with a long press, and locking/unlocking the screen. The Down Button switches between data screens during workouts and may activate the voice assistant if held. In specialized modes like Triathlon, the Down Button advances to the next segment; in Swim mode, the screen is locked by default. These functions are documented in the device’s button operation reference and Section 1.6 of the manual.
