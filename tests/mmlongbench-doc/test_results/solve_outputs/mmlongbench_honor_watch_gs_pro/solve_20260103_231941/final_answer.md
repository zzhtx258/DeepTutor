### S1: Analysis of Icon Colors for Moving and Removing Apps

In this step, we aimed to evaluate the user's question regarding the specific colors of icons that users interact with to move and remove applications in mobile interfaces. The inquiry is focused on identifying standard or commonly used colors associated with these functionalities.

To address this, we executed a series of queries aimed at uncovering the standard colors for the icons representing the actions of moving and removing apps. Unfortunately, all attempts to retrieve relevant information resulted in responses indicating insufficient data. Specifically, the tool executions returned summaries stating:

- There is a lack of information regarding the standard colors of icons used for moving and removing apps in mobile applications ([rag-6]).
- Similarly, queries about commonly used colors for these icons also yielded no results ([rag-7]).
- Additionally, inquiries into common conventions or standards for these icon colors returned the same outcome of insufficient information ([rag-8]).

Given the absence of specific data from the executed queries, we conclude that the colors of the icons for moving and removing apps are not defined in the available materials. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the colors associated with these actions in mobile applications at this time. 

In summary, the analysis reveals that there is currently no accessible information on the colors of icons used for moving and removing apps, indicating a gap in the available knowledge base.

## S2: Contextual Analysis of Icon Usage for Moving and Removing Apps

In this step, we aimed to determine the context in which icons for moving and removing applications are used, specifically focusing on identifying common operating systems or applications that feature these functionalities. This analysis is critical as it may help narrow down the search for information regarding the colors associated with these icons.

To achieve this, we executed multiple queries targeting common mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android, as well as desktop operating systems like Windows and macOS. The intention was to gather insights on the standard practices and iconography associated with moving and removing apps across these platforms.

Unfortunately, all attempts to retrieve relevant information resulted in responses indicating insufficient data. The tool executions consistently returned summaries stating:

- There is a lack of information regarding common operating systems or apps that have icons for moving and removing applications, as well as the colors typically associated with these icons ([rag-9], [rag-10], [rag-11]).
- Each query confirmed the absence of specific details, indicating a gap in the available knowledge base concerning the icon colors and their contextual usage.

Given this lack of accessible information, we cannot definitively identify the operating systems or applications that utilize these icons, nor can we ascertain the colors typically associated with them. This absence of data highlights a significant limitation in our current understanding of iconography in mobile and desktop interfaces.

In summary, our analysis reveals that there is currently no available information regarding the context of icon usage for moving and removing apps, which further complicates our ability to provide insights into the colors associated with these actions.

## S3: Conclusion on Icon Colors for Moving and Removing Apps

In this step, we have thoroughly analyzed the available information regarding the colors of icons used for moving and removing applications. Despite executing multiple queries aimed at uncovering this specific data, all attempts have resulted in consistent findings of insufficient information.

The executed queries, which targeted the colors of icons for moving an app up and removing an app, returned summaries indicating that there is no relevant information available in the knowledge base. Specifically, the results confirmed that the colors associated with these functionalities are not documented or defined in the current context ([rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3], [rag-4], [rag-5]).

Consequently, we conclude that there is a significant gap in the available knowledge regarding the colors of icons for moving and removing apps. This lack of data prevents us from providing any definitive insights or standard practices related to the icon colors in mobile and desktop interfaces.

In summary, our investigation has reaffirmed that no relevant information exists concerning the colors of the icons used for moving and removing applications, highlighting a limitation in our understanding of this aspect of user interface design.
