## S1: Determining the Origin of All 12 References

The objective of this step is to determine how many of the 12 references in the report originate from the Pew Research Center, based on explicit contextual information provided. According to the available knowledge, all data, charts, and analyses cited in the report are explicitly authored and published by the Pew Research Center, including proprietary survey data such as the 2015 National Survey of Latinos [rag-1]. Furthermore, a direct summary from the provided materials confirms: “All 12 references in the report are from the Pew Research Center, as explicitly stated in the provided background information.” This statement leaves no ambiguity—the entire reference set is internally generated by the center.

Since the report’s references are not drawn from external academic journals, third-party institutions, or independent publishers, but are instead products of the Pew Research Center’s own research infrastructure, surveys, and publications, it follows that all 12 references are internally sourced.

### Summary  
All 12 references in the report are authored and published by the Pew Research Center, as confirmed by the provided background information [rag-1]. Therefore, the number of references originating from its own research center is 12.
