Multiple visualizations—including bar charts and line charts—on Latino economic optimism, personal financial ratings, and intergenerational mobility are explicitly attributed to Pew Research Center publications. The reports cited, such as “Latinos Increasingly Confident in Personal Finances, See Better Economic Times Ahead” (2015) and “Statistical Portrait of Hispanics in the United States” (2016), are authored and released by the Pew Research Center itself. The center’s branding is consistently present in the visual elements, with its name displayed in bold, capitalized sans-serif font at the bottom of each chart. Additionally, the methodology and sampling details, including the 2015 National Survey of Latinos with a sample size of 1,500, are documented as part of Pew’s own research operations. All findings and visual representations are grounded in Pew’s proprietary surveys and analyses, affirming its role as the sole research institution behind the reported data.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
