## S1: Analysis of Disaggregated Data Availability for Hispanic Subgroups (2008–2015)

To determine which Hispanic subgroup — such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban — gained the most confidence from 2008 to 2015, we must first establish whether the report contains disaggregated data by national origin subgroup over this time period.

According to the available materials, **no charts, tables, or textual analyses in the report present financial confidence levels broken down by specific Hispanic subgroups** (e.g., Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban) for the years 2008 to 2015 [rag-1]. The published results aggregate data across these origin groups and instead categorize respondents by broader demographic variables such as nativity, generation, gender, education level, and age [rag-1].

This means that while the survey may have included participants from major Hispanic origin groups, the final public-facing report does not provide the necessary granularity to compare trends in confidence levels between these subgroups over time. Without such disaggregated data, it is impossible to identify which subgroup experienced the greatest gain in confidence during this period.

In summary, the foundational requirement for answering the user’s question — namely, subgroup-specific trend data — is absent from the report. Therefore, any attempt to identify a “most confident-gaining” subgroup would be speculative and unsupported by evidence.

### Summary
The report does not contain disaggregated confidence data by Hispanic subgroups (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban) from 2008 to 2015. All available analyses are aggregated across origin groups or categorized by other demographic dimensions. Consequently, determining which subgroup gained the most confidence during this period is not possible based on the current materials.
