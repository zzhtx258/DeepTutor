      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, **no charts or tables in the report show confidence levels specifically broken down by Hispanic subgroups such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban from 2008 to 2015**.\n\nThe available data and visualizations focus on broader demographic categories within the Latino/Hispanic population, including:\n\n*   **Nativity**: U.S.-born vs. Foreign-born (excluding Puerto Rico for foreign-born; including Puerto Rico for U.S.-born).\n*   **Generation**: Second generation, Third or higher generation (though data for these groups was unavailable for 2008).\n*   **Gender**: Male vs. Female.\n*   **Education Level**: Less than high school, High school graduate, Some college or more.\n*   **Age Groups**: Ages 18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65 and older.\n\nWhile the report mentions that the survey sample included a large number of respondents from major Hispanic origin groups (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban) and that analyses were conducted to ensure representativeness, the specific financial optimism data presented in the charts and tables is aggregated across these origin groups or categorized by the demographic variables listed above. The methodology section notes that the study employed stratified sampling to oversample areas with higher densities of Latino residents, but it does not indicate that the final published results include disaggregated data by national origin subgroup for the 2008-2015 financial confidence trends.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
