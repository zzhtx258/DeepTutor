## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification of the Group with the Most Significant Drop in Financial Strain (2014–2015)

To determine which group experienced the most significant drop in the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living from 2014 to 2015, we analyze the comparative data across racial/ethnic groups as reported by the Pew Research Center [rag-1].

According to the available data:

- **White adults (non-Hispanic)** saw a decline from **59%** in 2014 to **49%** in 2015 — a **10 percentage point drop**.
- **Black adults** experienced a smaller decline, from **55%** to **51%** — a **4 percentage point drop**.
- **Hispanic adults** showed **no change**, remaining at **53%** across both years.

Thus, the group with the most significant drop is **White adults (non-Hispanic)**, with a decrease of **10 percentage points**.

This result is derived directly from the horizontal stacked bar chart referenced in the report, which visually and numerically captures the shift in perceived financial strain across demographic groups over this one-year period [rag-1].

### Summary
White adults (non-Hispanic) exhibited the largest reduction in the share of households reporting income falling behind living costs — dropping 10 percentage points from 59% to 49% between 2014 and 2015. This represents the most substantial improvement in perceived financial stability among the groups analyzed during that timeframe.
