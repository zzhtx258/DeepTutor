      "raw_result": "The data comparing the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living by racial/ethnic group for 2014 and 2015 is presented in a **horizontal stacked bar chart** from the Pew Research Center, titled *“Latinos Increasingly Confident in Personal Finances, See Better Economic Times Ahead.”* The chart breaks down responses into three categories: “Falling behind,” “Staying about even with,” and “Going up faster than” the cost of living.\n\nBelow are the complete percentages for each group in both years:\n\n---\n\n### **Hispanic Adults**\n\n- **2015:**\n  - Falling behind: **53%**\n  - Staying about even with: **37%**\n  - Going up faster than: **10%**\n\n- **2014:**\n  - Falling behind: **53%**\n  - Staying about even with: **34%**\n  - Going up faster than: **9%**\n\n> *Note: Hispanic views remained unchanged between 2014 and 2015 — half continued to report their income was falling behind.*\n\n---\n\n### **White Adults (non-Hispanic)**\n\n- **2015:**\n  - Falling behind: **49%**\n  - Staying about even with: **43%**\n  - Going up faster than: **7%**\n\n- **2014:**\n  - Falling behind: **59%**\n  - Staying about even with: **33%**\n  - Going up faster than: **7%**\n\n> *Note: Whites showed improvement — a 10 percentage point drop in those reporting they were falling behind.*\n\n---\n\n### **Black Adults (non-Hispanic)**\n\n- **2015:**\n  - Falling behind: **51%**\n  - Staying about even with: **41%**\n  - Going up faster than: **7%**\n\n- **2014:**\n  - Falling behind: **55%**\n  - Staying about even with: **36%**\n  - Going up faster than: **8%**\n\n> *Note: Blacks also showed slight improvement — a 4 percentage point drop in those reporting they were falling behind.*\n\n---\n\nThese figures are derived from surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center:\n- **2014 survey:** January 15–19, 2014\n- **2015 survey:** December 8–13, 2015\n\nThe chart visually highlights that while Hispanic financial perceptions improved since 2008, their reported income relative to cost of living remained stagnant compared to other groups. Meanwhile, White and Black respondents showed modest improvements over the one-year period.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
