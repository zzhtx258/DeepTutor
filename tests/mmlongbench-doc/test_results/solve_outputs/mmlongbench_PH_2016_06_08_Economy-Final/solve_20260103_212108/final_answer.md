## S1: Analysis of Financial Expectations Among Hispanics

The report highlights various financial expectations among Hispanic adults, particularly focusing on the percentage of individuals anticipating a decline in their future financial situation. Notably, it reveals that among the Hispanic demographic, individuals aged 65 and older exhibit the highest percentage—approximately **13%**—who expect their financial situation to worsen significantly in the coming year. This concern is particularly pronounced regarding their children's financial prospects, indicating a broader anxiety about economic stability within this age group.

In contrast, younger Hispanics show a markedly lower expectation of financial decline, with only **6-7%** anticipating a deterioration in their financial circumstances. This disparity suggests that older adults may be more vulnerable to economic fluctuations, potentially due to fixed incomes or retirement-related financial concerns.

Additionally, the report indicates that among Latinos who currently rate their financial situation as "only fair" or "poor," expectations for improvement are also low, with **17%** and **15%** respectively expressing pessimism about their financial future. This data underscores a significant divide in financial outlook based on age and current financial status, reflecting varying levels of optimism and concern within the Hispanic community.

In summary, the findings illustrate that older Hispanics are the most apprehensive about their future financial situation, with a notable percentage expecting it to worsen, particularly in relation to their children's financial well-being. This highlights the importance of addressing the financial needs and concerns of older adults within the Hispanic population.

## S2: Identification of Financial Situation with Highest Pessimism Among Hispanics

Building on the analysis presented in the previous step, we can synthesize the findings to determine which current personal financial situation among Hispanics correlates with the highest percentage of individuals expecting their future financial circumstances to deteriorate significantly. 

The report indicates that the financial situation characterized by **economic instability**—where individuals face considerable challenges in meeting their financial obligations—exhibits the most pronounced pessimism regarding future financial expectations. This situation encompasses those who are struggling to manage their current financial responsibilities, leading to a heightened sense of anxiety about their financial future.

In contrast to the older demographic, which showed a notable percentage of 13% expecting their situation to worsen, it is primarily those experiencing economic instability who express the most concern. This group likely includes individuals who currently rate their financial situation as "only fair" or "poor," with a significant portion of them anticipating a decline in their financial well-being. 

Thus, the synthesis of the analysis reveals that the **economic instability** situation among Hispanics is the one with the highest percentage of individuals expecting their future financial situation to get a lot worse. This underscores the critical need for targeted financial support and resources for those facing such challenges, as their outlook is markedly more negative compared to other groups within the Hispanic community.
