## Concise Answer

The 5% figure does not represent Latinos who see economic upward mobility for their children; it is an unclassified survey category. The correct answer is that **72%** of Latinos expect their children to be better off financially.

However, the question asks: *“How do 5% of the Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children?”*

Based on the analysis, **5% do not see economic upward mobility** — they are part of the unclassified/residual category, not affirmative believers.

Thus, the precise answer to the question as phrased is:

## Detailed Answer

## S1: Interpreting the 5% Figure in Latino Economic Mobility Expectations

The query references a claim that “5% of Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children,” but this is a misinterpretation of the underlying data. According to the available evidence, the 5% figure does not represent Latino adults who believe their children will achieve economic upward mobility — rather, it corresponds to an “other” or unclassified response category in the survey data [rag-1]. 

The actual distribution of expectations among Latino adults is clearly documented: 72% expect their children to be financially better off than themselves, 16% expect them to be about the same, and 7% expect them to be worse off [rag-1]. These percentages sum to 95%, leaving the remaining 5% as responses that were not classified under the primary categories — such as “don’t know,” “refused to answer,” or other non-standard responses. This 5% is not a meaningful indicator of belief in upward mobility; it is a residual category used for data completeness, not substantive opinion.

Therefore, attributing the 5% figure to support the notion that only 5% of Latinos believe in upward mobility for their children is factually incorrect. The overwhelming majority — over seven in ten — hold optimistic views about their children’s economic future. The misattribution likely arises from conflating the unclassified “other” category with a direct response about mobility expectations, which is not supported by the source data.

In summary, the 5% figure reflects survey categorization residuals, not parental expectations. The true measure of optimism about economic mobility among Latino adults is found in the 72% who explicitly expect their children to be better off financially [rag-1].

    There is no evidence that 5% of Latinos report believing in economic upward mobility for their children. The data show that 72% of Latino adults expect their children to be better off financially, 16% expect the same, and 7% expect worse. The 5% figure mentioned in one chart refers to an unclassified or 'other' category, not a response about upward mobility.
