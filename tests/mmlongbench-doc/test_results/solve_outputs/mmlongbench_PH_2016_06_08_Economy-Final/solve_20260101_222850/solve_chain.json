      "step_response": "## S1: Interpreting the 5% Figure in Latino Economic Mobility Expectations\n\nThe query references a claim that “5% of Latinos see economic upward mobility for their children,” but this is a misinterpretation of the underlying data. According to the available evidence, the 5% figure does not represent Latino adults who believe their children will achieve economic upward mobility — rather, it corresponds to an “other” or unclassified response category in the survey data [rag-1]. \n\nThe actual distribution of expectations among Latino adults is clearly documented: 72% expect their children to be financially better off than themselves, 16% expect them to be about the same, and 7% expect them to be worse off [rag-1]. These percentages sum to 95%, leaving the remaining 5% as responses that were not classified under the primary categories — such as “don’t know,” “refused to answer,” or other non-standard responses. This 5% is not a meaningful indicator of belief in upward mobility; it is a residual category used for data completeness, not substantive opinion.\n\nTherefore, attributing the 5% figure to support the notion that only 5% of Latinos believe in upward mobility for their children is factually incorrect. The overwhelming majority — over seven in ten — hold optimistic views about their children’s economic future. The misattribution likely arises from conflating the unclassified “other” category with a direct response about mobility expectations, which is not supported by the source data.\n\nIn summary, the 5% figure reflects survey categorization residuals, not parental expectations. The true measure of optimism about economic mobility among Latino adults is found in the 72% who explicitly expect their children to be better off financially [rag-1].",
