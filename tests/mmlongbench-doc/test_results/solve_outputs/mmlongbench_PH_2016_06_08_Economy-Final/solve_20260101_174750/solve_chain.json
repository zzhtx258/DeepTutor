      "step_response": "## S1: Identify the Hispanic Subgroup with the Largest Increase in Confidence in Personal Finances (2008–2015)\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center’s National Survey of Latinos, the Hispanic subgroup that experienced the largest increase in confidence regarding personal finances between 2008 and 2015 was Latinos aged 18 to 29 [rag-1]. During this period, the proportion of young Hispanic adults who rated their financial situation as “excellent” or “good” rose by 27 percentage points, from 21% in 2008 to 48% in 2015 [rag-1]. This marked the most substantial gain among all analyzed subgroups, including those categorized by education level, birth status, or other age brackets [rag-1].\n\nThe magnitude of this increase—nearly doubling the share of respondents reporting positive financial perceptions—suggests a significant shift in economic outlook among young Hispanic adults during the post-recession recovery period. While other subgroups also showed improvements, none matched the scale of this 27-point rise, making Latinos aged 18 to 29 the clear outlier in terms of confidence growth.\n\nThis trend may reflect broader socioeconomic changes, such as increased educational attainment, labor market participation, or improved access to financial services among younger Hispanic cohorts during this era [rag-1].\n\nIn summary, the data unequivocally identifies Latinos aged 18 to 29 as the Hispanic subgroup with the greatest gain in confidence in personal finances from 2008 to 2015.",
