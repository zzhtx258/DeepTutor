## Detailed Answer

## S1: Analysis of Household Income Claims from 2014 to 2015

To identify the group with the most significant drop in the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living from 2014 to 2015, we must analyze the available data. However, the information regarding the percentage changes for various racial or ethnic groups is limited.

From the knowledge base, it is noted that Latino households reported a consistent figure of 53% for both years, indicating no percentage drop in their claims regarding income not keeping up with the cost of living. Specifically, the data states:

- In 2014, 53% of Latino households claimed their income was falling behind the cost of living.
- In 2015, this percentage remained unchanged at 53% [rag-1][rag-2].

Unfortunately, the report does not provide specific percentage changes for other groups, such as whites or blacks, nor does it indicate which group, if any, experienced a significant drop. The absence of detailed data for these groups means that we cannot definitively identify the group with the most significant drop in claims.

In summary, due to the lack of available data on percentage changes for different groups, it is not possible to determine which group had the most significant drop in the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living between 2014 and 2015.

## S2: Analysis of Percentage Drop for Identified Group from 2014 to 2015

In our analysis of the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living from 2014 to 2015, we have determined that there is no group identified with a significant drop in claims. The only data available pertains to Latino households, which consistently reported a percentage of 53% for both years. This indicates that there was no percentage drop for this group, as their claims remained unchanged at 53% in both 2014 and 2015 [rag-1][rag-2].

Unfortunately, the report does not provide specific percentage changes for other racial or ethnic groups, such as whites or blacks. The absence of detailed data for these groups means that we cannot ascertain whether they experienced any significant changes in their claims regarding income not keeping pace with the cost of living during this period. Thus, based on the available information, we conclude that there is no identified group with a notable decrease in the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living between 2014 and 2015.

In summary, the only group for which we have data is the Latino households, and they did not experience any percentage drop, maintaining a steady claim of 53%.
