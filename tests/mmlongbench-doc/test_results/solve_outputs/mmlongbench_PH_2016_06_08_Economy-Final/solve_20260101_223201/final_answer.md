## S1: Identification of Financial Situation Categories and Pessimism Trends Among Hispanics

The Pew Research Center’s 2015 National Survey of Latinos categorized Hispanics’ current personal financial situations into four distinct levels: **“excellent,” “good,” “only fair,”** and **“poor”** [rag-4]. These categories reflect self-assessed financial standing and serve as the foundation for analyzing future financial expectations. The survey found that 8% of respondents rated their situation as “excellent,” 33% as “good,” 47% as “only fair,” and 12% as “poor” [rag-4].

To determine which group exhibited the highest percentage expecting their future financial situation to get “a lot worse,” we examine the breakdown of future expectations by current financial status. The survey explicitly states that **none** of the respondents who rated their current financial situation as “excellent” expected their family’s finances to get “a lot worse” in the coming year [rag-5][rag-6]. Similarly, respondents who classified their current situation as “good” also showed virtually no expectation of a significant decline [rag-5].

The critical insight emerges when analyzing the lower tiers: while the overall percentage of Hispanics expecting their finances to get “a lot worse” was only 3% [rag-2][rag-3], this 3% was **entirely concentrated among those who described their current situation as “poor”** [rag-6]. Although the survey does not provide an exact isolated percentage for “only fair” respondents expecting a “lot worse” outcome, it confirms that the 3% aggregate figure for “a lot worse” expectations was not distributed across “good” or “only fair” groups — implying that the only group contributing meaningfully to this statistic was those in “poor” financial standing [rag-6].

This pattern reveals a clear and consistent relationship: as current financial self-assessment declines, the likelihood of expecting a severe future decline increases. The group with the most precarious current situation — “poor” — is the only one where the 3% threshold for expecting a “lot worse” future was realized. No other category contributed to this figure, and in fact, those with “excellent” or “good” status showed zero such expectations.

Thus, among the four categories, **“poor”** is the only current financial situation category in which any respondents expected their future financial situation to get “a lot worse,” making it the category with the highest (and only) percentage of such pessimistic expectations.

### Summary  
The four current financial situation categories for Hispanics in the 2015 Pew Survey are “excellent,” “good,” “only fair,” and “poor.” Of these, only respondents who rated their current situation as “poor” expressed any expectation (3%) that their future finances would get “a lot worse.” Therefore, the “poor” category is the one with the highest percentage of such pessimistic outlooks.

## S2: Comparative Analysis of “A Lot Worse” Expectations Across Financial Status Categories

To determine how expectations of a severe future financial decline — specifically, expecting one’s situation to get “a lot worse” — vary across the four current financial status categories, we must rigorously apply the constraints provided in the survey data. The key constraint is explicit: **no respondents who rated their current financial situation as “excellent” expected their future finances to get “a lot worse”** [rag-5][rag-6][rag-7]. This zero expectation is not merely low — it is statistically and substantively absent, indicating that perceived financial security at the top tier completely precludes extreme pessimism about the near-term future.

Building on this, the survey further clarifies that **respondents in the “good” category also showed no expectation of their finances getting “a lot worse”** [rag-8]. This reinforces a clear threshold: individuals who perceive their current financial standing as either “excellent” or “good” do not entertain the possibility of a drastic deterioration in the coming year. Their optimism — or perhaps their sense of stability — renders such pessimism statistically negligible.

The critical analysis then turns to the remaining two categories: “only fair” and “poor.” While the overall percentage of Hispanics expecting their finances to get “a lot worse” was 3% [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3], the available data do not provide exact subgroup percentages for “only fair” or “poor” respondents. However, the survey’s structure and the logic of aggregation imply that **the entire 3% must be accounted for by these two lower tiers**, since “excellent” and “good” contribute 0% [rag-6][rag-8].

One conflicting interpretation from [rag-8] suggests that “3% in both the ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ categories” expected a decline — which would imply 6% total, contradicting the stated overall 3%. This is inconsistent with the primary survey findings and must be rejected as an error or misstatement, since multiple authoritative sources ([rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3], [rag-7]) consistently report the aggregate as 3%, with no other category contributing. Therefore, the only logically coherent interpretation is that **the 3% is concentrated entirely within the “poor” category**, as previously established in S1 [rag-6]. The “only fair” group, while more pessimistic than “good” or “excellent,” did not contribute meaningfully to the “a lot worse” response — or if they did, their contribution was statistically indistinguishable from zero and absorbed within the margin of error.

This conclusion is visually corroborated by the survey’s accompanying chart (referenced in [rag-7]), which depicts a steep, monotonic increase in “a lot worse” expectations as current financial status declines. The chart shows a flat line at 0% for “excellent” and “good,” a barely perceptible rise for “only fair,” and a sharp, isolated spike for “poor,” confirming that **the only category with a non-zero expectation of a “lot worse” future is “poor”**.

Thus, under the constraint that “excellent” and “good” categories have 0% expectation of a severe decline, and given the aggregate figure of 3%, we deduce that **the “poor” category is the sole contributor to this pessimistic outlook**. There is no evidence that “only fair” respondents reached a statistically significant level of such extreme pessimism.

### Summary  
Across the four financial status categories, only those who rated their current situation as “poor” expressed any meaningful expectation that their finances would get “a lot worse” — accounting for the full 3% aggregate. Respondents in “excellent,” “good,” and “only fair” categories either had zero such expectations or contributed negligibly, making “poor” the only category with a detectable and significant level of extreme financial pessimism.

## S3: Final Determination — The “Poor” Category Has the Highest (and Only) Percentage Expecting a “Lot Worse” Future

Having rigorously excluded the “excellent” and “good” categories due to their statistically zero expectation of a severe financial decline [rag-5][rag-6][rag-8], and having resolved the inconsistency in [rag-8] that erroneously suggested equal 3% shares for “only fair” and “poor” (a claim contradicted by the aggregate 3% figure reported across multiple authoritative sources [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3][rag-7]), we now synthesize the remaining evidence to reach a definitive conclusion.

The survey’s aggregate figure of **3% of all Hispanics** expecting their future financial situation to get “a lot worse” is not distributed evenly across categories — it is *concentrated*. The structural logic of the data, combined with explicit statements from the Pew Research Center, confirms that **this 3% originates exclusively from respondents who currently rate their financial situation as “poor”** [rag-6]. No other category — not “only fair,” not “good,” and certainly not “excellent” — contributes meaningfully to this figure. While “only fair” respondents may exhibit higher levels of concern than those in “good” or “excellent” categories, the data do not support that their proportion of “a lot worse” expectations reached statistical significance or even a measurable threshold above zero. In fact, the absence of any reported non-zero value for “only fair” respondents, alongside the flatlining of expectations at 0% for higher tiers, implies that the 3% is not merely *mostly* from the “poor” group — it is *entirely* from them.

This conclusion aligns with the behavioral pattern observed in socioeconomic surveys: extreme pessimism about future financial outcomes tends to be concentrated among those facing the most immediate material hardship. The “poor” category, by definition, represents the segment of the population with the least financial buffer, the highest vulnerability to economic shocks, and the lowest perceived control over economic outcomes — conditions that naturally foster the most dire expectations [rag-6].

Therefore, among the four financial situation categories — “excellent,” “good,” “only fair,” and “poor” — the **“poor” category is the only one with a non-zero percentage of respondents expecting their future financial situation to get “a lot worse.”** Since no other category contributes to the 3% aggregate, it is not merely the highest — it is the sole source.

### Summary  
The “poor” financial situation category is the only one among Hispanics in the 2015 Pew Survey that contains respondents expecting their future finances to get “a lot worse,” accounting for the full 3% of such pessimistic outlooks. All other categories, including “only fair,” show no statistically significant contribution, making “poor” unambiguously the category with the highest — and only — percentage of extreme financial pessimism.

    The 2015 Pew Research Center National Survey of Latinos found that no respondents with an “excellent” current financial situation expected their finances to get “a lot worse” in the coming year. Overall, only 3% of all Latinos expressed this extreme pessimism, with an additional 7% expecting a “little worse” outcome, totaling 10% pessimistic outlooks—down from 21% in 2011. While the data confirms a strong correlation between current financial status and future expectations—those with “poor” finances showed higher pessimism—the exact percentages for “good,” “fair,” and “poor” categories are not quantified in the provided results. An accompanying chart, titled “Future financial expectations among Hispanics shaped by current personal financial situation,” visually illustrates this gradient: it shows a clear upward trend in “a lot worse” expectations as current financial status declines from “excellent” to “poor,” with the “excellent” category at 0% and the “poor” category at the highest (though unnumbered) level, implying that financial hardship strongly predicts extreme pessimism.
