This represents a significant decline from 2008, when 16% expressed this pessimistic view, and from 2011, when it was 21%. The overall trend indicates a sharp reduction in pessimism about future financial conditions, with most Hispanics now expressing optimism or neutrality about their economic outlook.\n\nAdditionally, the data show that among those who rate their current financial situation as “excellent,” no respondents expected their finances to get “a lot worse,” reinforcing the strong correlation between current financial well-being and future expectations.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

      "raw_result": "According to the Pew Research Center’s 2015 National Survey of Latinos, only a small minority of Hispanics expect their family’s financial situation to get worse in the coming year. Specifically, just 3% of Hispanics believe their finances will get “a lot worse,” and an additional 7% expect them to get “a little worse.” This means that only 10% of Hispanics anticipate any decline in their financial situation over the next 12 months.\n\nImportantly, among those who rate their current financial situation as “excellent,” none reported expecting their family’s finances to get “a lot worse” in the future. This highlights a strong correlation between current financial perceptions and future expectations: those who feel financially secure are far less likely to anticipate deterioration.\n\nThe survey also found that pessimism about future finances has declined significantly since the Great Recession. In 2008, 16% of Hispanics expected their finances to get worse, rising to 21% in 2011. By 2015, that share had dropped to just 10%, reflecting a substantial improvement in economic sentiment.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

The survey found that only 3% of all Hispanics overall expected their finances to get 'a lot worse,' and pessimism was lowest among those with excellent current financial standing, indicating that those with the best current situation had the lowest likelihood of expecting a significant decline.",

      "raw_result": "According to the 2015 Pew Research Center National Survey of Latinos, only a small minority of Hispanic adults expected their family’s financial situation to worsen in the coming year. Specifically, 3% of Latinos said they expected their finances to get “a lot worse,” and 7% said they expected them to get “a little worse.” Combined, these two categories account for 10% of respondents who anticipated a decline in their financial situation.
