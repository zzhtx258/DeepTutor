Among those who rated their current finances as “excellent,” none reported expecting their family’s finances to get “a lot worse.” This is explicitly noted in the survey’s methodology and visual data, which state that “no respondents who reported excellent financial condition said they expect their family’s finances to get a lot worse.” For those in other categories, pessimistic expectations were minimal: only 3% of all Latinos expected their finances to get “a lot worse,” and an additional 7% expected them to get “a little worse.” Combined, only 10% of Latinos anticipated a decline in their family’s financial situation over the next year.\n\nThe data further indicate that financial optimism was strongly tied to current perceptions: those who viewed their finances as “excellent” or “good” were far more likely to expect improvement, while those rating their situation as “only fair” or “poor” were significantly less optimistic. However, even among those with less favorable current conditions, expectations of major financial deterioration remained very low.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
