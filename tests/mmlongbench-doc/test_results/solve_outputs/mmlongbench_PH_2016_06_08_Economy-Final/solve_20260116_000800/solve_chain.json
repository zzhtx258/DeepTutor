      "step_response": "## S1: Identification and Counting of Comparative Charts Between General Public and Latinos/Hispanics\n\nBased on the available materials, there are **five distinct charts** in the Pew Research Center report that compare the general public with Latinos/Hispanics across financial and economic indicators. These charts are treated as separate visualizations even if some share similar titles or thematic focus, in accordance with the user’s definition that “a few small charts sharing the same chart title is considered one chart” — meaning only those explicitly grouped under identical titles are consolidated.\n\nThe five comparative charts are:\n\n1. **Two line charts** tracking personal financial confidence and future economic expectations among Latinos/Hispanics versus the general public from 2004 to 2015.\n2. A **horizontal bar chart** comparing changes in optimism between 2008 and 2015 for Latinos/Hispanics relative to the general public.\n3. A **stacked bar chart** illustrating income versus cost of living in 2014–2015, where non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks are used as proxies for the general public to contrast with Latino/Hispanic households.\n4. A **triptych of line charts** (three related but distinct plots) comparing Hispanic households with all U.S. households on income, poverty, and net worth from 2000 to 2014.\n\nEach of these visualizations serves a unique analytical purpose and presents distinct data dimensions, thereby qualifying as individual comparative charts under the specified criteria.\n\nThis count is derived directly from the summary provided in [rag-1], which explicitly states: *“There are five distinct charts...”* and further details their content and scope. No additional charts were identified through tool execution or image analysis, as no code outputs or images were generated in this step.\n\nIn summary, the total number of distinct charts comparing the general public with Latinos/Hispanics is **5**, based on explicit documentation in the source material.",
