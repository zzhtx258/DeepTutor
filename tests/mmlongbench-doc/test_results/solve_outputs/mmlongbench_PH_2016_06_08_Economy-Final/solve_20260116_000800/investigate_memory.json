      "raw_result": "Several charts in the Pew Research Center report titled *“Latinos Increasingly Confident in Personal Finances, See Better Economic Times Ahead”* directly compare the general public with Latinos/Hispanics across various financial and economic indicators. These visualizations highlight trends, gaps, and shifts in perception between these two demographic groups over time.\n\n### 1. **Line Charts Comparing Financial Confidence (2004–2015)**\n\nMultiple line charts track how perceptions of personal finances and future financial expectations have evolved for both Latinos/Hispanics and the general U.S. public from 2004 to 2015.\n\n- **Chart Title (Implicit):** *Latino perceptions of personal finances rebound strongly since the recession*\n  - Compares the percentage of respondents who rate their personal financial situation as “excellent” or “good.”\n  - Shows that while both groups declined during the Great Recession (shaded area), Latinos experienced a stronger recovery by 2015 — nearly closing the gap with the general public (40% vs. 43%).\n\n- **Chart Title (Implicit):** *Latinos more confident in personal finances than in 2008, see better economic times ahead*\n  - Focuses on expectations for financial improvement in the next year.\n  - Highlights a widening optimism gap: In 2015, 81% of Hispanics expected improvement versus 61% of the general public — a record 20-point difference since tracking began.\n\nThese line charts consistently use:\n- A **yellow-orange line with open circles** for Hispanics/Latinos.\n- A **brown line with filled circles** for the general public.\n- Shaded vertical bands to mark the **Great Recession (Dec 2007–Jun 2009)**.\n\n### 2. **Horizontal Bar Chart Comparing Financial Optimism (2008 vs. 2015)**\n\nThis chart provides a side-by-side comparison of financial optimism levels in 2008 and 2015 for both the general population and all Latinos, followed by detailed breakdowns by demographic subgroups (e.g., nativity, gender, education, age).\n\n- **Key Finding:** The general public’s optimism increased by only **6 percentage points** (from 56% to 61%), while Latinos’ rose by **14 points** (from 67% to 81%).\n- The chart visually emphasizes this divergence using **dark brown bars for 2015** and **light tan bars for 2008**, with a column showing the “Change '08-'15” percentage point difference.\n\n### 3. **Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart Comparing Family Income vs. Cost of Living (2014–2015)**\n\nThis chart compares how Hispanic, White, and Black adults perceive whether their family income is keeping pace with the cost of living.\n\n- Although not exclusively comparing Latinos with the general public, it includes data for **non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks**, which together represent the broader U.S. population.\n- In 2015, **53% of Hispanics** felt their income was falling behind — unchanged from 2014 — while **Whites showed modest improvement** (a 10-point drop in those feeling behind).\n- The chart uses color-coded segments: **dark brown** (“Falling behind”), **golden yellow** (“Staying about even”), and **light beige** (“Going up faster”).\n\n### 4. **Triptych of Line Charts Comparing Economic Indicators (2000–2014)**\n\nWhile not directly comparing sentiment, this set of three side-by-side line charts contrasts key economic outcomes for **Hispanic households** versus **all U.S. households**:\n\n- **Real Median Household Income**\n- **Poverty Rate**\n- **Median Net Worth**\n\nThese charts provide context for understanding why Latino financial optimism may diverge from objective economic indicators. For example:\n- Hispanic median household income remained stagnant at ~$42,500 in 2014, while all households saw a slight decline to ~$53,700.\n- The poverty rate for Hispanics peaked above 25% around 2010 and ended at 23.6% in 2014, compared to 14.8% for all households.\n- Hispanic net worth fell sharply post-recession and continued declining after 2009, unlike white households.\n\nEach chart uses:\n- A **gold/yellow line** for Hispanic households.\n- A **brown line** for all households.\n- Shaded areas to indicate recessions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Comparative Charts:\n\n| Chart Type | Comparison Focus | Key Insight |\n|------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Line Chart | Personal financial condition (2004–2015) | Latinos nearly caught up to the general public by 2015. |\n| Line Chart | Expectation of financial improvement (2004–2015) | Latinos’ optimism surged to 81%, far exceeding the general public’s 61%. |\n| Horizontal Bar Chart | Financial optimism change (2008–2015) | Latinos gained 14 points; general public gained only 6. |\n| Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart | Income vs. cost of living (2014–2015) | Hispanics’ views were stagnant; Whites improved slightly. |\n| Triptych Line Charts | Income, poverty, net worth (2000–2014) | Hispanic households lagged behind nationally in key economic metrics despite rising confidence. |\n\nThese charts collectively illustrate a nuanced picture: while Latinos express growing financial optimism and confidence — often surpassing the general public — objective economic indicators show limited progress for the community since the Great Recession.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
      "summary": "There are five distinct charts in the Pew Research Center report that compare the general public with Latinos/Hispanics across financial and economic indicators. These include: (1) two line charts tracking personal financial confidence and future expectations from 2004–2015; (2) a horizontal bar chart comparing optimism changes between 2008 and 2015; (3) a stacked bar chart on income vs. cost of living in 2014–2015 (including non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks as proxies for the general public); and (4) a triptych of line charts comparing Hispanic households with all U.S. households on income, poverty, and net worth from 2000–2014. Although some charts share similar titles or themes, each is treated as a separate comparative visualization per the user’s definition.",
