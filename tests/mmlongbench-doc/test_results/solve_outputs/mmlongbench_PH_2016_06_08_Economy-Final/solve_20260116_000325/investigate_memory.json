Within this sample, the subgroup of **Foreign Born Latinos (excluding Puerto Rico)** consisted of **795 respondents**.\n\nThis represents approximately **53%** of the total Latino survey sample (795 ÷ 1,500 = 0.53).\n\nAdditionally, the survey’s sampling methodology oversampled high-density Latino areas and used post-stratification weighting based on 2013 American Community Survey data to ensure national representativeness. The margin of error for this Foreign Born subgroup is **±4.4 percentage points** at the 95% confidence level.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
      "summary": "In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, Foreign Born Latinos (excluding Puerto Rico) numbered 795 out of 1,500 total Latino respondents, representing approximately 53% of the sample. The survey does not provide a separate population count or percentage for Latinos interviewed by cellphone, so a direct comparison cannot be made based on this result.",

      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, the 2015 National Survey of Latinos interviewed a total of **1,051 Latino respondents via cellphone**.\n\nThis figure is derived from the \"Interviews by Strata\" table, which breaks down the sample into landline and cellphone frames. The table explicitly states that the total number of interviews conducted via cellphone was 1,051 out of the overall sample of 1,500 Latino respondents.\n\nWhile the table does not provide a direct percentage of the *U.S. Latino population* represented by this cellphone sample, it does indicate that the cellphone frame was designed to reflect the estimated percentages of the U.S. Latino population across different strata (e.g., High, Medium, Low), with adjustments made through post-stratification weighting using data from the 2013 American Community Survey to ensure national representativeness.\n\nTherefore, the absolute count of Latino respondents interviewed by cellphone in the survey is **1,051**.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

The raw result does not provide the population count or percentage of foreign-born Latinos in the survey, so a direct comparison cannot be made based on this information alone. However, the cellphone-interviewed group represents a significant portion (70%) of the total sample.",
