## Detailed Answer

## S1: Population Comparison Between Foreign Born Latinos and Latinos Interviewed by Cellphone

To determine which group is larger in the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, we directly compare the absolute population counts provided in the survey data:

- **Foreign Born Latinos (excluding Puerto Rico)**: The survey reports a total of **795** respondents in this subgroup out of 1,500 total Latino respondents [rag-1].
- **Latinos interviewed by cellphone**: The survey conducted **1,051** interviews via cellphone, as explicitly stated in the “Interviews by Strata” table [rag-2].

Since both values are absolute counts from the same total sample size ($n = 1,500$), we can perform a direct numerical comparison:

$$
1,051 > 795
$$

Thus, the group of **Latinos interviewed by cellphone** is numerically larger than the group of **Foreign Born Latinos**.

### Summary
Based on the raw survey data, the population of Latinos interviewed by cellphone (1,051) exceeds that of Foreign Born Latinos (795). Therefore, in this survey, the cellphone-interviewed group is greater in size.

    In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, Foreign Born Latinos (excluding Puerto Rico) numbered 795 out of 1,500 total Latino respondents, representing approximately 53% of the sample. The survey does not provide a separate population count or percentage for Latinos interviewed by cellphone, so a direct comparison cannot be made based on this result.

    The survey interviewed 1,051 Latinos by cellphone out of a total sample of 1,500. The raw result does not provide the population count or percentage of foreign-born Latinos in the survey, so a direct comparison cannot be made based on this information alone. However, the cellphone-interviewed group represents a significant portion (70%) of the total sample.
