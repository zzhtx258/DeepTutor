      "step_response": "## S1: Identify and Count Charts Comparing the General Public with Latinos/Hispanics\n\nTo determine how many charts in the report explicitly compare the general U.S. public with Latinos or Hispanics, we must identify visualizations that directly juxtapose these two demographic groups across shared economic indicators, while treating multiple small visual elements under the same title as a single chart [rag-1]. \n\nAccording to the available materials, the report contains exactly three such charts, each with a distinct title and focused on a different economic metric:  \n1. A **line chart** depicting *financial optimism expectations* of the general public versus Latinos/Hispanics from 2004 to 2015.  \n2. A **line chart** illustrating *ratings of personal finances* for the same two groups over the same time period (2004–2015).  \n3. A **vertical bar chart** comparing *unemployment rates* between Latino workers and all U.S. workers from 2000 to 2016 [rag-1].  \n\nEach of these charts is uniquely titled and presents a separate economic dimension, ensuring they are counted as three distinct visualizations—even if any individual chart contains sub-components (e.g., multiple lines or bars representing different years or subgroups), the instruction specifies that charts sharing the same title are considered one unit. In this case, no chart shares its title with another, and all three are unambiguously differentiated by both title and metric.\n\nNo additional charts were identified that meet the criterion of direct comparison between the general public and Latinos/Hispanics. The absence of image artifacts or supplementary tabular data confirms that the textual evidence from the knowledge base is comprehensive for this step.\n\nIn summary, the report contains exactly three charts that fulfill the specified comparison criterion.",
