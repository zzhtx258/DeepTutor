      "raw_result": "The report includes several charts that compare the general U.S. public with Latinos or Hispanics across key economic perceptions and trends. These visualizations highlight disparities and shifts in optimism, financial well-being, and expectations over time.\n\nOne prominent line chart titled **“Percent who expect their family’s financial situation to improve 'a lot' or 'some' in the next year”** compares the trajectory of financial optimism between Latinos and the general U.S. public from 2004 to 2015. The chart shows that while both groups experienced a dip during the Great Recession (2007–2009), Latino optimism rebounded more sharply after 2011, rising from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015 — a 14-percentage-point increase. In contrast, the general public’s optimism increased by only 6 percentage points, from 56% in 2008 to 61% in 2015. This resulted in the largest gap between the two groups since the survey began in 2004, with Latinos outpacing the public by 20 percentage points in 2015.\n\nAnother line chart, **“Ratings of personal finances improve among most Latino groups,”** tracks the percentage of Latinos and the general public who rate their personal finances as “excellent” or “good.” The data reveal that Latino views improved significantly from 31% in 2004 to 40% in 2015, while the general public’s rating declined from 51% in 2004 to 43% in 2015. This reversal means that Latinos’ perceptions of their financial situation have not only recovered from the Great Recession but have also converged with — and in some cases surpassed — those of the broader population, closing an 18-percentage-point gap that existed in 2008.\n\nAdditionally, a vertical bar chart titled **“U.S. Latino unemployment rate is declining, but remains above its 2006 low”** presents a dual-line comparison of unemployment rates between Latino workers and all U.S. workers from 2000 to 2016. The chart illustrates that while both groups saw unemployment rise during the Great Recession and decline afterward, the Latino rate remained consistently higher — peaking at 12.8% in 2010 compared to 10% for all workers — and stood at 6.4% in late 2015, above the 5.6% rate for all workers.\n\nThese charts collectively underscore a central theme of the report: despite persistent economic challenges such as stagnant income and declining net worth, Latinos exhibit markedly higher levels of optimism about their financial future compared to the general public, particularly in terms of expectations for personal and intergenerational economic mobility.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

Each chart has a distinct title and focuses on a different economic indicator, but all directly compare the two groups.",
