Among these 12 references, five are directly attributed to the Pew Research Center. These include the primary report [1] *PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf*, along with four additional publications authored by Pew Research Center researchers in the years 2009, 2014, 2015, and 2016 [rag-1]. The affiliation of each reference is explicitly stated in the source material, ensuring that the identification of Pew Research Center outputs is based on direct institutional attribution rather than inference.\n\nThis means that exactly $ \\frac{5}{12} $, or approximately 41.7%, of the references in the report originate from the Pew Research Center itself.\n\n### Summary\nOf the 12 total references in the report, five are from the Pew Research Center, as directly supported by the provided knowledge base and tool results.",
