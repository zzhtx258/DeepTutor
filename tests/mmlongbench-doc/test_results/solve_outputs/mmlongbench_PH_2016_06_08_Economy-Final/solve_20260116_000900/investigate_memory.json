      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, the complete data comparing Hispanics' current personal financial situation with their expectation of their future financial situation getting \"a lot worse\" is presented in a **horizontal stacked bar chart** titled *\"Future financial expectations among Hispanics shaped by current personal financial situation.\"*\n\nThis chart details how respondents' self-reported current financial condition correlates with their expectations for their family's financial situation in the next year. The specific data for the \"Get a lot worse\" outcome category is as follows:\n\n*   **Excellent financial condition:** 0% expect their family’s finances to get a lot worse.\n*   **Good financial condition:** 2% expect their family’s finances to get a lot worse.\n*   **Only fair financial condition:** 5% expect their family’s finances to get a lot worse.\n*   **Poor financial condition:** 10% expect their family’s finances to get a lot worse.\n\nThe chart visually represents these percentages using color-coded segments within each bar corresponding to the four current financial condition categories. It clearly shows that the expectation of a significant financial decline (\"Get a lot worse\") increases as the current financial condition worsens. The surrounding text and chart caption also note that no respondents who reported being in \"excellent\" financial condition expected their finances to get a lot worse.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
      "summary": "Among Hispanics, those currently in 'poor' financial condition have the highest percentage (10%) expecting their future financial situation to get a lot worse. This is followed by 5% in 'only fair' condition, 2% in 'good' condition, and 0% in 'excellent' condition. The data comes from a horizontal stacked bar chart showing how current financial status correlates with expectations of significant future decline.",
