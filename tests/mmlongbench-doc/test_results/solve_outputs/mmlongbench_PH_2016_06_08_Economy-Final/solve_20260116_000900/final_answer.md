## S1: Identifying the Current Financial Situation with Highest Expectation of Future Decline Among Hispanics

To determine which current personal financial situation among Hispanics correlates with the highest percentage expecting their future financial condition to “get a lot worse,” we analyze the data presented in the horizontal stacked bar chart referenced in the materials.

According to the report, the expectation of significant future financial deterioration varies by current financial status as follows:

- **Poor**: 10% expect their future financial situation to get a lot worse  
- **Only fair**: 5% expect their future financial situation to get a lot worse  
- **Good**: 2% expect their future financial situation to get a lot worse  
- **Excellent**: 0% expect their future financial situation to get a lot worse  

These percentages are derived directly from the visual representation described in the source material [rag-1]. The pattern is clear: as current financial conditions worsen, the proportion of individuals anticipating a significant decline in their future financial situation increases. The highest expectation of deterioration occurs among those currently reporting their financial situation as “poor.”

This finding suggests a strong correlation between present hardship and pessimism about future financial stability within the Hispanic population surveyed.

In summary, among Hispanics, those currently in **poor** financial condition exhibit the highest percentage (10%) expecting their future financial situation to get a lot worse — significantly higher than any other group based on current status.
