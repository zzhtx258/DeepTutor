From Step S1, we established that there are four references specifically from the Pew Research Center. In Step S2, we identified that the report contains a total of 17 references.\n\nTo find the proportion of references from the research center, we can summarize the findings as follows:\n\n- Total references in the report: 17\n- References from the Pew Research Center: 4\n\nThus, the number of references from the research center is confirmed to be **4**. This indicates that approximately 23.5% of the references cited in the report originate from its own research center, which underscores the center's significant role in contributing to the report's findings.\n\nIn summary, the report cites four references from the Pew Research Center out of a total of 17 references, highlighting the center's contributions to the research presented.",
