      "raw_result": "In 2014 and 2015, about half of Latino adults reported that their family income was not keeping up with the cost of living, with no significant change between the two years. Specifically, in 2015, 53% of Latinos said their family income was falling behind the cost of living, which was unchanged from the 2014 figure. In contrast, 37% said their income was staying about even with the cost of living, and 10% said it was rising faster than the cost of living. These perceptions were similar across Black and White adults in 2015, indicating that the trend of income lagging behind inflation was not unique to Latinos but was shared broadly across racial and ethnic groups during that period.\n\nNo data in the provided context indicates a percentage drop in this measure between 2014 and 2015 for any specific household subgroup, as the share of Latinos reporting income falling behind the cost of living remained stable at 53% over that one-year period.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
      "summary": "The provided report indicates no significant drop in the percentage of households reporting that their income was falling behind the cost of living between 2014 and 2015 for any group, including Latinos, Black, or White adults. The percentage for Latinos remained stable at 53% in both years, and no other group showed a measurable decline.",
