      "raw_result": "In 2014 and 2015, Pew Research Center surveys revealed that a significant portion of Latinos reported their family income was not keeping pace with the cost of living, with minimal change between the two years. In 2015, 53% of Latinos said their family income was falling behind the cost of living, a figure unchanged from 2014. An additional 37% reported their income was staying about even with the cost of living, while 10% indicated their income was rising faster than living expenses. These proportions were similar across both years, indicating persistent economic strain despite improved perceptions of personal finances.\n\nThe data also show that views on income versus cost of living were comparable among Latinos, Blacks, and Whites in 2015, with all three groups reporting similar levels of income stagnation relative to living costs. However, unlike Hispanics and Blacks, Whites reported some improvement in family income relative to the cost of living between 2014 and 2015.\n\nWhile the survey provides aggregate figures for Latinos as a whole, it does not break down the percentages of income-cost-of-living disparities by specific demographic subgroups (such as age, education, or nativity) for 2014 and 2015. The report notes that the 53% figure for Latinos in both years reflects a consistent pattern across the broader population, but subgroup-specific data on income versus cost of living is not presented. Instead, subgroup analyses focus on financial optimism and self-rated personal finances, which showed marked improvements across groups such as young adults (18–29), foreign-born Latinos, and those with some college education between 2008 and 2015 — even as income lagged behind inflation.\n\nThus, while the overall rate of income falling behind the cost of living remained stable at 53% among Latinos from 2014 to 2015, detailed breakdowns by demographic or socioeconomic subgroups for this specific metric are not available in the provided data.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
