      "step_response": "## S1: Identify the Hispanic Subgroup with the Largest Increase in Financial Confidence (2008–2015)\n\nTo determine which Hispanic subgroup experienced the greatest gain in confidence regarding their financial future between 2008 and 2015, we analyze the reported changes in optimism levels across demographic categories. According to the Pew Research Center’s National Survey of Latinos, the subgroup showing the most substantial increase was Latinos aged 18–29 [rag-1]. \n\nIn 2008, only 21% of this group expressed a positive assessment of their personal financial situation. By 2015, that figure had risen sharply to 48%, representing a 27-percentage-point increase [$48\\% - 21\\% = 27\\%$] [rag-1]. This surge was the largest among all Hispanic subgroups surveyed during this period, outpacing gains observed in older age groups or other demographic segments. Additionally, the data highlights that younger Latinos under age 30 also demonstrated exceptional optimism about their family’s financial future, with 90% expressing confidence in 2015—further underscoring the generational shift in economic outlook [rag-1].\n\nThe magnitude of this change—nearly doubling the proportion of confident individuals in just seven years—suggests a profound transformation in economic self-perception among young Hispanic adults, potentially influenced by factors such as educational attainment, labor market entry, or broader societal shifts in economic messaging.\n\nIn summary, Latinos aged 18–29 are unequivocally the Hispanic subgroup that gained the most confidence in their financial future from 2008 to 2015, with a 27-percentage-point increase in positive assessments of personal finances.",
