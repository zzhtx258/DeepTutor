      "raw_result": "From 2008 to 2015, Hispanic subgroups across multiple demographic categories demonstrated significant increases in confidence regarding their personal finances and future economic prospects, according to the Pew Research Center’s National Survey of Latinos. While overall optimism rose sharply, the magnitude of improvement varied across subgroups.\n\nThe share of all Latinos who expected their family’s financial situation to improve “a lot” or “some” in the next year increased by 14 percentage points, from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015. This upward trend was consistent across nearly all subgroups. Younger Latinos showed the most dramatic gains: those under age 30 saw a 13-point increase in optimism, with 90% expressing confidence in their financial future in 2015. Similarly, Latinos aged 30–49 and 50–64 each experienced a 16-point rise in optimism. In contrast, those aged 65 and older had a more modest 7-point increase, with 59% expressing optimism in 2015—still the lowest among all age groups.\n\nEducational attainment also correlated with levels of optimism. Latinos with some college experience reported the highest optimism at 85% in 2015, up by 20 percentage points since 2008. High school graduates saw a 9-point increase (to 80%), while those with less than a high school education experienced an 11-point rise (to 77%). Despite these gains, disparities persisted, with college-educated Latinos maintaining the highest levels of confidence.\n\nIn terms of personal financial assessments, the share of Latinos rating their situation as “excellent” or “good” rose from 23% in 2008 to 40% in 2015. The largest improvement occurred among those aged 18–29, whose positive ratings jumped 27 percentage points—from 21% to 48%. U.S.-born and foreign-born Latinos both saw 14-point increases, reaching 81% optimism in both groups. Gender differences were also present: Latino men gained 18 percentage points in optimism, while Latina women gained 11 points.\n\nDespite these gains in optimism, economic indicators such as median household income and net worth remained stagnant or declined for many Hispanics, highlighting a disconnect between subjective confidence and objective economic conditions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
