      "raw_result": "According to the Pew Research Center’s 2015 National Survey of Latinos, only a small minority of Hispanics expect their family’s financial situation to worsen in the coming year. Specifically, just 3% of Hispanics said they expect their finances to get “a lot worse,” and an additional 7% said they expect them to get “a little worse.” Together, these pessimistic expectations account for only 10% of the total Hispanic population. This represents a significant decline from 2008, when 16% expressed similar pessimistic views, and from 2011, when the share was 21%.\n\nThe data further indicate that optimism about future finances is strongly tied to current financial conditions. Among those who rate their current finances as “excellent” or “good,” virtually no one expects their situation to get “a lot worse.” In contrast, among those who rate their current finances as “only fair” or “poor,” the share expecting a major decline remains low—15% for those in poor financial shape and 17% for those in fair shape expect “a lot” of improvement, not deterioration.\n\nThus, while many Hispanics acknowledge financial challenges—such as income not keeping pace with the cost of living—very few anticipate a significant worsening of their financial situation in the near term.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
      "summary": "Among Hispanics, those who rate their current financial situation as 'fair' have the highest percentage (17%) expecting their future financial situation to get a lot worse, according to the Pew Research Center’s 2015 National Survey of Latinos. However, this figure actually refers to those expecting improvement, not deterioration. The data show that among those with 'poor' current finances, 15% expect a lot of improvement, and the percentage expecting a lot worse is not explicitly stated but implied to be low overall, with only 3% of all Hispanics expecting their finances to get a lot worse. The survey indicates that pessimism about future finances is minimal across all current financial groups, with the highest rates of expected deterioration occurring among those in fair or poor financial standing, though exact figures for deterioration are not provided beyond the overall 3% for the entire Hispanic population.",

      "raw_result": "According to the 2015 National Survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Research Center, the vast majority of Hispanic adults do not expect their family’s financial situation to get worse in the coming year, regardless of their current financial condition. Specifically, only a small fraction of Latinos anticipate a decline in their finances:\n\n- Among those who rate their current financial situation as “excellent,” **none** reported expecting their family’s finances to get “a lot worse.”  \n- Overall, only **3%** of all Latinos said they expect their family’s finances to get “a lot worse” in the next year.  \n- An additional **7%** said they expect their finances to get “a little worse.”  \n\nThis means that only **10%** of Latinos overall expect their family’s financial situation to worsen in the next year, whether “a lot” or “a little.” These pessimistic expectations are even lower among those who currently rate their finances as “excellent” or “good,” with the highest rates of pessimism found among those who rate their current situation as “poor” or “only fair.” However, even among those in poor financial condition, the proportion expecting a major decline remains low, as most still hold some hope for improvement.\n\nThe data further show that optimism about future finances is strongly tied to current perceptions: while 89% of those in “excellent” or “good” financial shape expect some or a lot of improvement, only about half of those in “only fair” or “poor” conditions expect improvement — yet even among these groups, the share expecting a decline remains minimal.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The 2015 Pew Research Center National Survey of Latinos does not provide a breakdown of the percentage of Hispanics who expect their family’s financial situation to get “a lot worse” specifically by current financial condition (excellent, good, fair, poor). However, the survey does report overall pessimistic expectations across all groups.\n\nAccording to the data, only 3% of Latinos overall said they expected their family’s finances to get “a lot worse” in the coming year, and an additional 7% expected them to get “a little worse,” totaling 10% with some degree of pessimism. Notably, the survey explicitly notes that “no respondents who reported excellent financial condition said they expect their family’s finances to get a lot worse.” This implies that among those rating their current finances as “excellent,” the share expecting a significant decline is effectively zero.\n\nFor those with current financial conditions rated as “only fair” or “poor,” the survey indicates that while a small minority expect major deterioration (15% for “poor” and 17% for “only fair” expect improvement “a lot”), the data does not quantify how many of these groups expect their situation to get “a lot worse.” The survey’s focus is primarily on optimism, with pessimistic expectations (especially “a lot worse”) being rare overall and not broken down by current financial status beyond the exclusion of “excellent” respondents.\n\nThus, while the survey confirms that those in “excellent” financial shape do not anticipate major declines, it does not provide specific percentages for “good,” “fair,” or “poor” categories regarding expectations of financial deterioration.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
