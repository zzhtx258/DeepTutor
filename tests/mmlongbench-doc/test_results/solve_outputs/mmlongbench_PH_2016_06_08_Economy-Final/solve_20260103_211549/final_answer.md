## S1: Analysis of Confidence Gains Among Hispanic Subgroups (2008-2015)

To identify which subgroup among Hispanics gained the most confidence from 2008 to 2015, we can analyze the data regarding financial optimism during this period. According to the findings from the Pew Research Center, there was a notable increase in financial confidence among various Hispanic subgroups, reflecting a broader trend of rising optimism following the Great Recession.

The subgroup that exhibited the most significant gain in confidence is Hispanics aged under 30. This demographic showed an impressive 13 percentage point increase in their expectations regarding financial improvement, with 90% of individuals in this age group anticipating a better financial situation by 2015. This increase is particularly noteworthy as it demonstrates a shift in perspective among younger Hispanics, who are often more vulnerable to economic fluctuations.

In comparison, other subgroups, such as those aged 30-49 and 50-64, also experienced increases in confidence, both achieving a 16 percentage point rise in optimism. However, the highest percentage of individuals expecting financial improvement was recorded among the younger demographic, solidifying their position as the subgroup with the most substantial gain in confidence during the specified timeframe.

Overall, the financial confidence among Hispanics rose from 67% in 2008 to 81% in 2015, indicating a significant upward trend in optimism across the board, but particularly pronounced among younger adults under 30 years old. This shift not only highlights the resilience of this demographic but also suggests a growing sense of hope and expectation for improved financial circumstances in the years following the economic downturn.
