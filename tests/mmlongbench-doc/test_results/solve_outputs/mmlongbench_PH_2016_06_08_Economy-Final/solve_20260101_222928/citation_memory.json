      "raw_result": "The 2015 National Survey of Latinos, conducted by the Pew Research Center, included a nationally representative sample of 1,500 Latino adults, with 795 respondents identified as foreign-born (excluding Puerto Rico). This subgroup represented 53% of the total sample, reflecting the demographic composition of the U.S. Latino population at the time. The survey employed a dual-frame design—combining landline and cellular telephone samples—to ensure broad coverage, with oversampling in areas with higher densities of Latino residents to improve representation.\n\nThe foreign-born subgroup was analyzed separately from U.S.-born Latinos (including Puerto Rico, n=705), and statistical weighting was applied to correct for sampling imbalances and align results with benchmarks from the 2013 American Community Survey. The margin of error for the foreign-born subgroup was ±4.4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level, slightly higher than the total sample’s margin of error (±3.3%) due to its smaller size.\n\nFindings from the survey indicate that foreign-born Latinos exhibited similar levels of financial optimism as their U.S.-born counterparts: both groups saw a 14-percentage-point increase in confidence about their family’s financial future since 2008, with 81% of each group expecting improvement in the coming year. Additionally, 75% of foreign-born adults expressed optimism that their children would be better off financially than they are, compared to 70% of U.S.-born adults.\n\nThe survey also revealed differences in self-reported financial conditions: 31% of foreign-born Latinos rated their personal finances as “excellent” or “good” in 2015, compared to 41% of U.S.-born Latinos. Despite these disparities, foreign-born Latinos showed strong economic optimism, particularly regarding intergenerational mobility and future prospects.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",

      "content": "In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos by the Pew Research Center, 795 out of 1,500 Latino adults surveyed were identified as foreign-born, representing 53% of the sample. The survey included both landline and cellphone respondents, and the foreign-born subgroup was explicitly defined as those born outside the U.S. (excluding Puerto Rico). Since the survey sampled both landline and cellphone users together, and the foreign-born group was a subset of the total Latino sample, the number of foreign-born Latinos interviewed (795) is greater than the number of Latinos interviewed by cellphone alone, as the cellphone sample was part of the overall dual-frame design and not a separate population count.",
