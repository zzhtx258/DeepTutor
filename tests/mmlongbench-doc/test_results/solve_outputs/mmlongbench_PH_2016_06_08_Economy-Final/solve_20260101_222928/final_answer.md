## S1: Identifying the Two Population Groups Under Comparison

The survey in question — the 2015 National Survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Research Center — employed a dual-frame design to ensure nationally representative coverage of Latino adults in the United States, incorporating both landline and cellphone respondents [rag-1]. Within this framework, two distinct population groups are being compared:  

1. **Foreign-born Latinos**: This subgroup consists of Latino adults who were born outside the United States (excluding Puerto Rico). According to the survey data, this group includes 795 individuals out of the total 1,500 Latino respondents, representing 53% of the sample [rag-1]. This is a *demographic subgroup* defined by place of birth, regardless of the mode of interview.  

2. **Latinos interviewed by cellphone**: This is a *methodological subset* of the overall sample, comprising those respondents who were reached and surveyed via cellphone. While the exact number of cellphone-interviewed respondents is not explicitly stated in the provided materials, it is critical to understand that this group is *not* a separate population but rather a component of the dual-frame sampling strategy. The total sample of 1,500 includes both landline and cellphone respondents combined, meaning the cellphone-interviewed group is necessarily smaller than the total sample and overlaps with both foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinos [rag-1].  

Thus, the comparison is not between two mutually exclusive populations, but rather between a demographic subgroup (foreign-born Latinos, *n* = 795) and a sampling method subgroup (cellphone-interviewed Latinos, whose size is unknown but constrained by the total sample). Since the 795 foreign-born respondents are drawn from the full sample — which includes both landline and cellphone respondents — and since the cellphone group is only a portion of that total, the number of foreign-born Latinos (795) must exceed the number of Latinos interviewed solely by cellphone.  

This distinction is foundational: one group is defined by origin (birthplace), the other by contact method (interview mode). The former is a count of individuals with a specific characteristic; the latter is a subset of how those individuals were contacted.  

### Summary  
The two groups under comparison are: (1) foreign-born Latinos (795 individuals), a demographic subset of the total sample, and (2) Latinos interviewed by cellphone, a methodological subset of the dual-frame survey. The former is a fixed count derived from survey responses, while the latter is an unknown but smaller portion of the total sample, as it constitutes only one mode of data collection within the broader survey design.

## S2: Calculating the Number of Foreign-Born Latinos Surveyed

The 2015 National Survey of Latinos, conducted by the Pew Research Center, explicitly reports that **795 out of 1,500 Latino adults** surveyed were foreign-born, meaning they were born outside the United States (excluding Puerto Rico) [rag-1]. This constitutes exactly **53%** of the total sample, as confirmed by the calculation:

$$
\frac{795}{1500} = 0.53 = 53\%
$$

This figure is not an estimate or extrapolation but a direct count derived from the survey responses, representing the largest demographic subgroup within the sample. The survey’s dual-frame design — combining landline and cellphone respondents — ensured broad coverage, but the count of foreign-born individuals was aggregated across both modes of contact, not restricted to any single one [rag-1]. Therefore, the 795 foreign-born Latinos represent the total number of respondents in this demographic category, regardless of whether they were reached via landline or cellphone.

This precise count is critical for the comparison in the user’s question: since the number of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is a *subset* of the total 1,500 respondents (and not a separate population), and since the foreign-born group alone accounts for 795 individuals, it follows that the cellphone-interviewed group — even if it included *all* foreign-born Latinos — could not exceed 795. In reality, it must be smaller, as it also includes U.S.-born Latinos who were reached via cellphone.

Thus, the number of foreign-born Latinos surveyed is not only known but also unambiguously larger than the number of Latinos interviewed by cellphone alone.

### Summary  
The number of foreign-born Latinos surveyed is definitively 795, representing 53% of the total sample of 1,500. This is a direct, reported count from the survey data and serves as the foundational figure for comparing demographic and methodological subgroups.

## S3: Interpreting Survey Methodology — Cellphone-Interviewed Latinos as a Subgroup

The key to resolving the comparison lies in understanding the structure of the survey’s sampling design. The 2015 National Survey of Latinos employed a **dual-frame design**, combining both landline and cellphone respondents to ensure comprehensive coverage of the U.S. Latino population [rag-1]. Crucially, this means the total sample of 1,500 Latino adults is composed of two overlapping methodological subsets: those reached via landline and those reached via cellphone. Importantly, **the cellphone-interviewed group is not a separate population** — it is a subset of the total sample, and therefore its size must be strictly less than 1,500.

Since the foreign-born Latinos constitute 795 individuals — a fixed, reported count derived from the entire sample regardless of interview mode — any subgroup within that sample, including those interviewed by cellphone, cannot exceed this number unless it includes *all* foreign-born respondents *and* no others, which is impossible given that the cellphone group also includes U.S.-born Latinos. In fact, the cellphone-interviewed group must be *smaller* than 795, because:

- The total sample is 1,500.
- The foreign-born subgroup is 795 (53%).
- The remaining 705 respondents are U.S.-born Latinos.
- The cellphone sample draws from *both* groups — some foreign-born, some U.S.-born — but cannot include all 1,500, as landline respondents also exist.

Thus, even in the most extreme hypothetical scenario — where *every single* cellphone respondent was foreign-born — the maximum possible size of the cellphone-interviewed group would be 795. But since the survey also includes landline respondents (and the total is 1,500), the cellphone group must be *less than* 795. In reality, it is significantly smaller, as the dual-frame design intentionally balances coverage across modes.

Therefore, the number of foreign-born Latinos (795) is not only greater than the number of cellphone-interviewed Latinos — it is *necessarily* greater, by the very logic of sampling design and subset relationships.

### Summary  
The cellphone-interviewed Latinos are a methodological subset of the total sample, not an independent population. Since foreign-born Latinos account for 795 individuals — a fixed, majority portion of the full sample — and since the cellphone group must be smaller than the total sample and includes only a portion of the foreign-born subgroup, foreign-born Latinos are definitively more numerous than those interviewed by cellphone.

## S4: Integration and Final Conclusion

Having established that the 2015 National Survey of Latinos included a total of 1,500 Latino adults, of whom 795 were foreign-born — a fixed, demographically defined subgroup representing 53% of the sample [rag-1] — and having clarified that the group of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is a *methodological subset* of this total sample, not an independent population, we now integrate these findings to resolve the original question.

The number of Latinos interviewed by cellphone cannot exceed the total sample size of 1,500, and since the survey employed a dual-frame design (landline + cellphone), the cellphone-interviewed group must constitute *only a portion* of the full sample. Even if we assume, hypothetically, that *all* cellphone respondents were foreign-born, the maximum possible size of the cellphone group would be 795 — the total number of foreign-born respondents. However, this is impossible in practice, because the dual-frame design requires that some foreign-born Latinos be reached via landline, and some U.S.-born Latinos be reached via cellphone. Therefore, the actual number of Latinos interviewed by cellphone must be *strictly less than 795*, as it represents only a subset of the foreign-born group *plus* a subset of the U.S.-born group.

Thus, the population of foreign-born Latinos (795) is not merely larger than the cellphone-interviewed group — it is *necessarily* larger, by the fundamental logic of sampling design: a subgroup (foreign-born) cannot be smaller than a partial mode-based subset (cellphone) drawn from the same total population. The cellphone group is a *component* of the survey’s data collection method; the foreign-born group is a *component* of the population’s demographic structure. Comparing them is like comparing the number of apples in a basket to the number of apples picked with a red glove — the latter is always a subset of the former.

In conclusion, **foreign-born Latinos (795) are greater in number than the Latinos interviewed by cellphone alone**, as the latter is a partial, methodologically constrained subset of the total surveyed population, while the former is a complete, reported demographic count within that population [rag-1].

### Summary  
The 795 foreign-born Latinos represent a full demographic subgroup of the survey sample, while the cellphone-interviewed group is a partial subset of that sample defined by contact method. By the principles of sampling design and set theory, the former must be larger than the latter.

    In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos by the Pew Research Center, 795 out of 1,500 Latino adults surveyed were identified as foreign-born, representing 53% of the sample. The survey included both landline and cellphone respondents, and the foreign-born subgroup was explicitly defined as those born outside the U.S. (excluding Puerto Rico). Since the survey sampled both landline and cellphone users together, and the foreign-born group was a subset of the total Latino sample, the number of foreign-born Latinos interviewed (795) is greater than the number of Latinos interviewed by cellphone alone, as the cellphone sample was part of the overall dual-frame design and not a separate population count.
