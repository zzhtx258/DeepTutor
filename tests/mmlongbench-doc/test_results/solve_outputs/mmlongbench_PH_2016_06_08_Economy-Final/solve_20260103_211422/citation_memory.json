However, the survey design focused on maximizing representation across diverse Latino subpopulations.\n\nThese figures highlight the proportion of foreign-born Latinos within the surveyed population and the method through which a significant number of interviews were conducted. The data illustrate the considerations in sampling methodologies aimed at achieving demographic representation among Latinos in the United States.\n\n### References\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
