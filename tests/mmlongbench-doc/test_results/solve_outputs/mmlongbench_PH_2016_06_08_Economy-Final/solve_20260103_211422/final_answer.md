## Detailed Answer

## S1: Population Analysis of Foreign-Born Latinos vs. Latinos Interviewed by Cellphone

In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, we have specific data regarding the populations of foreign-born Latinos and Latinos interviewed by cellphone. The survey included a total of **1,500 Latino respondents**, among which **795 were identified as foreign-born Latinos**. This group represented approximately **53%** of the total sample size. 

On the other hand, the survey also indicated that **1,051 interviews were conducted via cellphone**. This means that cellphone interviews constituted a significant portion of the survey's methodology, which aimed to capture a comprehensive view of the Latino population in the United States.

To directly compare these two groups:

- **Foreign-born Latinos**: 795 respondents
- **Latinos interviewed by cellphone**: 1,051 respondents

From this data, it is clear that the population of Latinos interviewed by cellphone (1,051) is greater than that of foreign-born Latinos (795). Therefore, we can conclude that Latinos interviewed by cellphone outnumber foreign-born Latinos in this survey, highlighting the importance of cellphone interviews in reaching a broader segment of the Latino community.

In summary, based on the data from the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, the population of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is indeed greater than that of foreign-born Latinos.

## S2: Integration of Findings on Population Comparison

In synthesizing the findings from the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, we can clearly determine which group has a greater population based on the provided data. The survey revealed that there were **795 foreign-born Latinos** and **1,051 Latinos interviewed by cellphone**. 

To establish which group is larger, we can directly compare the two populations:

- **Foreign-born Latinos**: 795 respondents
- **Latinos interviewed by cellphone**: 1,051 respondents

Since **1,051** (Latinos interviewed by cellphone) is greater than **795** (foreign-born Latinos), we conclude that the population of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is indeed greater than that of foreign-born Latinos. This finding underscores the significance of cellphone interviews in capturing a larger segment of the Latino community, which may reflect broader accessibility and representation in survey methodologies.

In summary, the analysis confirms that Latinos interviewed by cellphone outnumber foreign-born Latinos in this survey, highlighting the effectiveness of cellphone-based outreach in demographic studies.
