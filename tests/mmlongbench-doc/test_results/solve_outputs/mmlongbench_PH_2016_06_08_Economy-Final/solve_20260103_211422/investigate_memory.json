However, the survey design focused on maximizing representation across diverse Latino subpopulations.\n\nThese figures highlight the proportion of foreign-born Latinos within the surveyed population and the method through which a significant number of interviews were conducted. The data illustrate the considerations in sampling methodologies aimed at achieving demographic representation among Latinos in the United States.\n\n### References\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
      "summary": "In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos, there were 795 foreign-born Latinos, making up 53% of the total sample of 1,500 respondents. In contrast, 1,051 interviews were conducted via cellphone, but the specific number of cellphone interviews that were foreign-born Latinos is not detailed. Therefore, while foreign-born Latinos constitute a significant portion of the population surveyed, the exact comparison with Latinos interviewed by cellphone cannot be directly determined from the provided data.",
