## S2: Implications of Latino Adults' Beliefs About Their Children's Financial Future

The statistic indicating that only **5%** of Latino adults believe their children will experience economic upward mobility reveals a stark contrast to the previously mentioned optimism expressed by the majority. This low percentage suggests a significant level of pessimism or concern regarding the financial opportunities available to the next generation within the Latino community. 

This perception of limited upward mobility may stem from various systemic barriers that Latino families face, including economic inequality, discrimination, and a lack of access to essential resources such as quality education and job opportunities. These challenges can create a sense of hopelessness among parents, leading them to doubt that their children will achieve better financial outcomes than they themselves have experienced. 

Moreover, this belief can profoundly influence the aspirations and support that Latino parents provide to their children. If parents perceive a lack of opportunities, they may be less likely to encourage their children to pursue higher education or ambitious career paths, fearing that such efforts may not yield the desired results. This cycle of pessimism can perpetuate existing disparities and hinder the potential for economic advancement within the community.

In summary, the belief held by only **5%** of Latino adults in their children's economic upward mobility underscores a critical concern about the barriers to financial success that may exist. It highlights the need for targeted interventions and policies that address these systemic issues to foster a more equitable environment where all children, regardless of their background, can aspire to and achieve better economic futures.
