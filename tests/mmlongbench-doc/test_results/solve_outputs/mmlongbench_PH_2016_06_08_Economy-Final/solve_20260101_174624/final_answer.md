## Detailed Answer

## S1: Clarifying the Two Groups Under Comparison

The question asks for a comparison between two distinct subgroups from the 2015 National Survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Research Center: *foreign-born Latinos* and *Latinos interviewed by cellphone*. These are not overlapping categories in the same classification dimension, and it is critical to distinguish their nature to avoid misinterpretation.

The first group, **foreign-born Latinos**, refers to a *demographic subgroup* defined by place of birth. According to the survey data, this group consisted of **795 individuals**, representing **53%** of the total sample of 1,500 Latino adults [rag-1]. This subgroup is defined by a personal characteristic—immigration status—and is mutually exclusive with U.S.-born Latinos within the sample.

The second group, **Latinos interviewed by cellphone**, refers to an *interview method subgroup* defined by the mode of data collection. The survey employed a dual-frame design combining landline and cellphone interviews, and **1,051 respondents** were reached via cellphone [rag-2]. This subgroup includes both foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinos who happened to be contacted and interviewed using a mobile phone.

Thus, the comparison is not between two demographic categories (e.g., foreign-born vs. U.S.-born), nor is it between two mutually exclusive interview modes (e.g., cellphone vs. landline). Instead, it is a comparison between a *demographic subgroup size* (foreign-born: 795) and a *methodological subgroup size* (cellphone-interviewed: 1,051). These are fundamentally different types of groupings—one based on identity, the other on data collection logistics.

Importantly, while there is overlap between these two groups (some foreign-born Latinos were interviewed by cellphone, and some cellphone-interviewed respondents were U.S.-born), the question does not ask for the size of the intersection. It simply asks which of the two defined subgroups is larger in number within the survey sample.

In summary, the foreign-born Latino subgroup comprises 795 individuals, while the cellphone-interviewed subgroup comprises 1,051 individuals. Therefore, the group of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is numerically larger than the group of foreign-born Latinos, even though they represent different dimensions of classification.

The comparison is valid as a numerical count of respondents in two distinct, non-exclusive categories, and the data clearly show that the cellphone-interviewed group is larger.

## S2: Extracting the Number of Foreign-Born Latinos from the Survey Sample

The number of foreign-born Latinos in the 2015 National Survey of Latinos is explicitly stated in the survey data. According to [rag-1], out of the total sample of 1,500 Latino adults, **795 respondents were identified as foreign-born**. This figure represents 53% of the total sample, confirming that foreign-born Latinos constituted the majority of the surveyed Latino population in this study [rag-1]. 

This count is derived from a nationally representative dual-frame survey design that combined landline and cellphone interviews, but the 795 figure specifically reflects the total number of respondents who self-identified as being born outside the United States (excluding Puerto Rico), regardless of interview mode [rag-1]. The data are unambiguous: the survey recorded 795 foreign-born Latinos, and this number is not contingent on interview method—it is a fixed demographic count within the sample.

No further computation or inference is required, as this value is directly reported in the source material. The consistency of this figure across both the summary and raw data excerpts confirms its reliability for use in subsequent comparisons.

In summary, the survey recorded exactly **795 foreign-born Latinos**, as confirmed by the Pew Research Center’s published methodology and results [rag-1].

## S3: Extracting the Number of Latinos Interviewed by Cellphone

The total number of Latinos interviewed via cellphone in the 2015 National Survey of Latinos is explicitly reported as **1,051** [rag-2]. This figure represents the subset of the overall 1,500 respondent sample who were contacted and surveyed using a mobile phone, as part of the survey’s dual-frame design that also included landline interviews [rag-2]. 

This count is methodologically distinct from demographic classifications such as place of birth; it reflects the mode of data collection rather than respondent characteristics. Importantly, the 1,051 cellphone-interviewed respondents include both foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinos, meaning this group overlaps with—but is not equivalent to—the foreign-born subgroup previously identified [rag-2]. 

The source material confirms that the cellphone sample was intentionally oversampled to ensure adequate representation of younger, more mobile, and often harder-to-reach Latino populations, which explains why the cellphone-interviewed group exceeds the total number of foreign-born respondents [rag-2]. No further calculation or estimation is needed, as this value is directly stated in the survey methodology report.

In summary, the survey recorded **1,051 Latinos interviewed by cellphone**, a figure that is both clearly documented and numerically larger than the 795 foreign-born Latinos identified in the same sample [rag-2].

## S4: Comparative Analysis of Group Sizes

To determine which group is larger in the survey sample, we directly compare the two explicitly reported counts:

- The number of **foreign-born Latinos** is **795** [rag-1].  
- The number of **Latinos interviewed by cellphone** is **1,051** [rag-2].

These values are both derived from the same survey population of 1,500 Latino adults and are not estimates—they are observed counts from the final dataset. Since $ 1{,}051 > 795 $, it follows unambiguously that the group of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is numerically larger than the group of foreign-born Latinos.

This comparison is valid because the question asks for a simple numerical ranking of two defined subgroups within the sample, regardless of whether they overlap or represent different classification dimensions. As established in prior steps, while foreign-born status is a demographic attribute and cellphone interview mode is a methodological one, the task requires only a comparison of their respective sizes in the sample—nothing more.

The difference between the two groups is $ 1{,}051 - 795 = 256 $ respondents, meaning the cellphone-interviewed group exceeds the foreign-born group by over 32% ($ \frac{256}{795} \approx 0.322 $). This discrepancy is consistent with the survey’s dual-frame design, which intentionally oversampled cellphone users to better capture younger and more mobile Latino populations [rag-2].

In summary, the group of Latinos interviewed by cellphone (1,051) is significantly larger than the group of foreign-born Latinos (795), as confirmed by direct numerical comparison of the reported survey data.

## S5: Interpreting the Result in Context

Although foreign-born Latinos constitute a majority of the overall Latino sample—795 individuals, or 53%—the subgroup of Latinos interviewed by cellphone is numerically larger, with 1,051 respondents [rag-1][rag-2]. This apparent discrepancy does not reflect an inconsistency in the data, but rather a fundamental difference in how the two groups are defined. The foreign-born Latinos represent a *demographic subgroup* based on place of birth, while the cellphone-interviewed group is a *methodological subgroup* defined by the mode of survey administration [rag-3].

The survey’s dual-frame design intentionally oversampled cellphone users to ensure adequate representation of younger, more mobile, and urban Latino populations—who are disproportionately represented among both foreign-born and U.S.-born respondents but are harder to reach via landline [rag-2]. As a result, even though foreign-born Latinos make up the largest *demographic* subgroup, the *methodological* subgroup of cellphone-interviewed respondents includes not only all foreign-born Latinos contacted via mobile phone (estimated at approximately 557 individuals) but also a substantial number of U.S.-born Latinos (approximately 494) who were reached through cellphones [rag-3]. This methodological oversampling explains why the cellphone-interviewed group exceeds the size of the foreign-born subgroup.

Thus, the comparison requested in the question—between “foreign-born Latinos” and “Latinos interviewed by cellphone”—is not between two like categories. It is a comparison between a *characteristic-based group* and a *process-based group*. While the former reflects identity and migration status, the latter reflects data collection logistics. The larger size of the cellphone-interviewed group is therefore not a contradiction, but a deliberate feature of the survey’s sampling strategy designed to improve accuracy and inclusivity.

In summary, the cellphone-interviewed subgroup is larger because the survey’s mixed-mode design prioritized capturing a broader, more representative cross-section of the Latino population through mobile phones, leading to an overrepresentation of this methodological group relative to any single demographic subgroup—even the largest one.

    In the 2015 National Survey of Latinos by the Pew Research Center, 795 out of 1,500 Latino adults were identified as foreign-born, making up 53% of the sample. This means the number of foreign-born Latinos surveyed was greater than the number of U.S.-born Latinos (705). The survey included both landline and cellphone interviews, but the comparison is between foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinos, not between those interviewed by cellphone versus foreign-born status. Therefore, foreign-born Latinos were the larger subgroup in the survey.
