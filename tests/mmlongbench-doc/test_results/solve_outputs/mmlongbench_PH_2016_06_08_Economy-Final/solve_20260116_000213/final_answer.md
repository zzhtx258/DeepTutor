## S1: Analysis of Latino Perspectives on Children’s Economic Upward Mobility

According to the Pew Research Center report titled *“Latinos Increasingly Confident in Personal Finances, See Better Economic Times Ahead,”* a small but notable minority — specifically **5% of Latino adults** — expect their children to be **less well off financially than themselves** [rag-1]. This finding represents a pessimistic outlook within an otherwise overwhelmingly optimistic demographic. 

The majority of Latino respondents (72%) believe their children will achieve greater financial success than they have, reflecting strong confidence in intergenerational upward mobility despite broader societal economic challenges [rag-1]. The 5% who hold a contrary view may reflect concerns related to systemic barriers, economic uncertainty, or personal experiences that temper expectations for future generations.

This data point is significant because it highlights internal diversity in economic sentiment within the Latino community — even amid widespread optimism, a measurable segment anticipates downward mobility for their children.

### Summary
While most Latino adults are optimistic about their children’s financial futures, 5% anticipate their children will be less well off than themselves — a critical minority perspective that warrants attention in discussions of economic equity and generational opportunity.
