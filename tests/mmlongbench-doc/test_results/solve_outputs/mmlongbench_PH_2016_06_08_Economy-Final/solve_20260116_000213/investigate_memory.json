      "raw_result": "According to the Pew Research Center report titled *“Latinos Increasingly Confident in Personal Finances, See Better Economic Times Ahead,”* Latino adults express strong optimism regarding the financial future of their children. The report highlights that **72% of Latino adults expect their children to be financially better off than themselves**, reflecting a widespread belief in intergenerational economic upward mobility.\n\nSpecifically, the data mentioning **5%** refers to the segment of Latino adults who hold a more pessimistic view: **5% expect their children to be less well off financially than they are**. This small but notable minority contrasts sharply with the majority’s optimism.\n\nThe report further breaks down these expectations by demographic factors:\n- **Age**: Younger Latinos (ages 18–29) are the most optimistic, with 75% expecting their children to be better off, while older Latinos (65+) are less so, with only 52% holding this view.\n- **Education**: High school graduates are the most optimistic subgroup (79%), followed by those with some college or more (69%).\n- **Nativity**: Immigrant adults (75%) and U.S.-born adults (70%) both show high levels of optimism, though immigrants are slightly more hopeful.\n\nThis optimism persists despite broader economic indicators showing stagnation in income and wealth for the Latino community since the Great Recession. The report underscores that while economic realities may not yet reflect this optimism, the belief in upward mobility remains a defining feature of Latino economic outlooks.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf",
