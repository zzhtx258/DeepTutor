## S1: Identify Charts Comparing the General Public with Latinos or Hispanics

To determine how many charts in the report explicitly compare the general U.S. public with Latinos or Hispanics, we must apply a precise criterion: a chart must present a direct, side-by-side comparison between these two groups — not merely show trends within the Latino population or include other demographic comparisons without a clear contrast to the general public [rag-1]. 

According to the available analysis, two charts meet this criterion. The first is a **line chart** depicting the trajectory of *financial optimism regarding future family finances* for both the general U.S. public and Latinos/Hispanics, spanning the years 2004 to 2015. This visualization clearly juxtaposes how each group’s expectations evolved over time, revealing diverging trends — for instance, Latinos showed increasing optimism while the general public’s remained relatively flat or declined [rag-1]. The second is another **line chart** illustrating *changes in self-rated personal finances* over the same period, again contrasting the two groups and demonstrating a convergence in how individuals assessed their current financial standing [rag-1]. 

A third chart, which examines financial expectations *within* Latino subgroups (e.g., by nativity, generation, or country of origin), was explicitly excluded because it does not involve any comparison with the general U.S. public. As per the instruction that “a few small charts sharing the same chart title are considered one chart,” each of the two qualifying charts is treated as a single unit, even if composed of multiple overlapping lines or subplots under a unified title.

Thus, after filtering out all non-comparative or intra-group charts, only two charts satisfy the requirement of directly comparing the general U.S. public with Latinos or Hispanics.

The total number of charts that meet the specified criteria is therefore **2**.

    Two charts in the report directly compare the general U.S. public with Latinos or Hispanics: one line chart tracking financial optimism about future family finances from 2004 to 2015, and another showing changes in self-rated personal finances over the same period. Both highlight diverging trends in future expectations and converging trends in current financial self-assessment. A third bar chart compares financial expectations within Latino groups but does not contrast Latinos with the general public, so it is not counted.
