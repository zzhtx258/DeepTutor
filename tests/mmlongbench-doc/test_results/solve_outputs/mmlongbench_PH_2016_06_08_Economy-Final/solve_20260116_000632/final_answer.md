## S1: Identification of References from the Own Research Center

Based on the provided summary from the knowledge base, the report cites a total of 12 references. Among these, **8 references are authored or produced by Pew Research Center itself**. These include works by researchers such as Kochhar, Fry, Taylor, Lopez, Stepler, and Brown, as well as institutional reports published in 2009, 2014, and 2015 [rag-1].

The remaining 4 references originate from external institutions:  
- National Center for Health Statistics  
- U.S. Census Bureau  
- National Bureau of Economic Research  
- University of Georgia’s Selig Center  

This classification is derived directly from the textual analysis of the single document `[1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf`, which contains all cited sources within its bibliography section [rag-1].

Thus, among the 12 references, **exactly 8 are from its own research center**.

### Summary
