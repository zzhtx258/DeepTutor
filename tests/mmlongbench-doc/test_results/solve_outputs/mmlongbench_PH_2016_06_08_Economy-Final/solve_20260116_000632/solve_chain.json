These include works by researchers such as Kochhar, Fry, Taylor, Lopez, Stepler, and Brown, as well as institutional reports published in 2009, 2014, and 2015 [rag-1].\n\nThe remaining 4 references originate from external institutions:  \n- National Center for Health Statistics  \n- U.S. Census Bureau  \n- National Bureau of Economic Research  \n- University of Georgia’s Selig Center  \n\nThis classification is derived directly from the textual analysis of the single document `[1] PH_2016.06.08_Economy-Final.pdf`, which contains all cited sources within its bibliography section [rag-1].\n\nThus, among the 12 references, **exactly 8 are from its own research center**.\n\n### Summary\nThe report’s bibliography includes 12 cited works, 8 of which are internal publications from Pew Research Center, confirming that the majority of references originate from within the organization.",
