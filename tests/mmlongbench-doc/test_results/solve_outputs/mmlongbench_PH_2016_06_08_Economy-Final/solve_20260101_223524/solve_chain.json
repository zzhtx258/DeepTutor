      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of the Demographic Group with the Most Significant Drop (2014–2015)\n\nThe objective of this step is to identify which demographic group experienced the most significant *drop* in the percentage of households reporting that their income was falling behind the cost of living between 2014 and 2015. To address this, we examine the available evidence from the report and tool execution results.\n\nAccording to the provided material, the percentage of Latino households reporting that their income was not keeping up with the cost of living remained *unchanged* at 53% from 2014 to 2015 [rag-1]. Crucially, the summary and raw excerpt from the tool execution results explicitly state: “No demographic group experienced a drop in the percentage of households claiming their income was falling behind the cost of living from 2014 to 2015” [rag-1]. This includes all other demographic groups, none of which are reported to have shown a decline in this metric during the specified period.\n\nSince a drop implies a *decrease* in percentage from one year to the next, and no group—neither Latinos nor any other demographic category—experienced such a decrease, it follows that there is no group that qualifies as having the “most significant drop.” The data indicates stability across the board, with no downward trend observed in any subgroup.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, there is no demographic group that experienced a drop in this metric between 2014 and 2015, and consequently, no percentage drop can be identified.\n\n### Summary\nNo demographic group experienced a decline in the percentage of households reporting income falling behind the cost of living from 2014 to 2015; all groups, including Latinos, showed no change. Thus, the premise of the question—that such a drop occurred—is not supported by the data.",
