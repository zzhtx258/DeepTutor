## S1: Availability Assessment of Vietnam’s iOS 7 Adoption Rate in Q3 2015

To determine whether Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate as of Q3 2015 is higher or lower than the global average (19%), we must first verify whether country-specific adoption data for Vietnam is available in the provided materials.

According to the retrieved knowledge base entries, while the global iOS 7 adoption rate for Q3 2015 is explicitly stated as **19%** [rag-1], there is no breakdown of this metric by country or region. Specifically, no table, chart, or textual reference provides Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption percentage during that period [rag-2]. Although Vietnam’s overall iOS market share was reported as 31% at the time, this figure reflects total iOS usage across all versions and does not isolate iOS 7 adoption [rag-2].

Furthermore, tool execution confirms that no such data exists within the provided knowledge base — meaning it is impossible to compare Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate with the global average or compute a percentage difference [tool-execution].

Therefore, based on the current evidence, the requested comparison cannot be performed due to the absence of Vietnam-specific iOS 7 adoption data for Q3 2015.

### Summary
Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate for Q3 2015 is not available in the provided materials. Consequently, no valid comparison can be made against the global average of 19%, and the percentage difference cannot be calculated.
