Specifically, no table, chart, or textual reference provides Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption percentage during that period [rag-2]. Although Vietnam’s overall iOS market share was reported as 31% at the time, this figure reflects total iOS usage across all versions and does not isolate iOS 7 adoption [rag-2].\n\nFurthermore, tool execution confirms that no such data exists within the provided knowledge base — meaning it is impossible to compare Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate with the global average or compute a percentage difference [tool-execution].\n\nTherefore, based on the current evidence, the requested comparison cannot be performed due to the absence of Vietnam-specific iOS 7 adoption data for Q3 2015.\n\n### Summary\nVietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate for Q3 2015 is not available in the provided materials. Consequently, no valid comparison can be made against the global average of 19%, and the percentage difference cannot be calculated.",
