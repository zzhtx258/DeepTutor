According to the available data, the approximate cost per install was between 0.3 and 0.4 VND. This information is crucial for understanding the financial implications of utilizing such platforms for mobile advertising in that period.

Based on the findings, the boundary costs for installing a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam can be summarized as follows:

- **Lower Boundary**: 0.3 VND
- **Upper Boundary**: 0.4 VND

Thus, the cost range in VND for installing a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam in Q3 2015 is approximately **[0.3, 0.4]**.

## S2: Conversion of Cost Range from VND to USD

To derive the cost range for installing a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam in Q3 2015 from Vietnamese Dong (VND) to US Dollars (USD), we will utilize the exchange rate of 22,000 VND per USD, which was applicable during that period.

Given the previously identified cost range of **[0.3, 0.4] VND**, we will convert these values to USD using the following formula:

$$
\text{USD Cost} = \frac{\text{VND Cost}}{\text{Exchange Rate}}
$$

Applying this to our boundaries:

1. **Lower Boundary Conversion**:
   - For the lower boundary of 0.3 VND:
   $$
   \text{Lower Boundary in USD} = \frac{0.3}{22000} \approx 0.00001363636 \text{ USD}
   $$

2. **Upper Boundary Conversion**:
   - For the upper boundary of 0.4 VND:
   $$
   \text{Upper Boundary in USD} = \frac{0.4}{22000} \approx 0.00001818182 \text{ USD}
   $$

Thus, the approximate cost range in USD for installing a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam in Q3 2015 is **[0.00001363636, 0.00001818182]** USD. 

For practical purposes, this can be rounded to **[0.000014, 0.000018]** USD, reflecting the conversion from VND to USD accurately within the context of the given exchange rate. 

In summary, the derived cost range in USD for the installation of a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam during Q3 2015 is approximately **[0.000014, 0.000018]**.
