## Detailed Answer

## S1: Availability of 2014 Mobile App Counts for Apple App Store and Google Play Store

The objective of this step is to determine whether the exact number of mobile apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for the year 2014 is available in the provided knowledge base. After reviewing all available citations and tool execution results, it is confirmed that **no exact figures for the total number of apps in either store for 2014 are present** in the provided materials [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3].

All sources consistently state that the closest available data pertains to the year 2015, not 2014. Specifically, in 2015, the Google Play Store had over 1.6 million apps, while the Apple App Store had 1.5 million apps [rag-1]. These figures reflect growth trends from prior years, including 2014, but do not provide the precise counts for the target year. No tool search, internal database query, or external data source has yielded 2014-specific numbers, and no supplementary visualizations or tables are available to infer or approximate the 2014 values.

Therefore, while we can infer that both stores experienced growth between 2014 and 2015 — and that Google Play Store likely led in app count even in 2014 based on its 2015 dominance — the exact numbers for 2014 remain unavailable within the current knowledge base.

### Summary
The exact number of mobile apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for 2014 is not available in the provided data. Only 2015 figures are accessible, which are insufficient to directly answer the question.

## S2: Inferring the Relative Scale of Mobile Apps in 2014 from 2015 Trends

Although the exact number of mobile apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for 2014 is not available in the provided data [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3], we can perform a valid inference based on the known 2015 figures and the well-documented growth trajectory of both platforms during this period.

In 2015, the Google Play Store reported over 1.6 million apps, while the Apple App Store had 1.5 million apps [rag-1]. This indicates that by 2015, Google Play had already established a lead of more than 100,000 apps. Historical context from industry reports and platform development patterns shows that both stores experienced consistent, year-over-year growth between 2013 and 2015, with Google Play typically growing at a faster rate due to its open ecosystem and broader device compatibility [rag-3].

Given this trend, it is highly unlikely that the Apple App Store surpassed Google Play in app count between 2014 and 2015. Rather, the 2015 gap of approximately 100,000 apps was the result of cumulative growth from prior years. Therefore, if Google Play held a numerical advantage in 2015, it is logically consistent to infer that it also held that advantage in 2014 — even if the absolute difference was smaller.

To illustrate this reasoning:  
Let $ A_{2014} $ and $ G_{2014} $ represent the number of apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, respectively.  
Let $ \Delta_A $ and $ \Delta_G $ represent the growth from 2014 to 2015 for each store.  
We know:  
$$
A_{2015} = A_{2014} + \Delta_A = 1.5 \text{ million}
$$  
$$
G_{2015} = G_{2014} + \Delta_G = 1.6 \text{ million}
$$  
$$
G_{2015} > A_{2015} \Rightarrow G_{2014} + \Delta_G > A_{2014} + \Delta_A
$$  

Since $ \Delta_G $ was consistently larger than $ \Delta_A $ during this period (as confirmed by industry trends), the only plausible scenario for $ G_{2015} > A_{2015} $ is that $ G_{2014} \geq A_{2014} $. In fact, given the magnitude of the 2015 gap and the sustained growth rate, $ G_{2014} $ was almost certainly greater than $ A_{2014} $.

Thus, based on the 2015 data and the established growth dynamics, we can confidently infer that **in 2014, the Google Play Store had more mobile apps than the Apple App Store**, even though the precise figures for 2014 are unavailable.

### Summary
While exact 2014 app counts are not recorded in the available data, the 2015 figures and the consistent growth pattern between the two platforms allow us to infer with high confidence that Google Play Store led in app volume as early as 2014.

## S3: Conclusion — Inference and Acknowledgment of Data Limitations

Based on the available 2015 data — where the Google Play Store hosted over 1.6 million apps and the Apple App Store had 1.5 million apps [rag-1] — and the well-documented, sustained growth trajectory of both platforms between 2013 and 2015, it is logically and statistically sound to infer that the Google Play Store already held a larger app catalog than the Apple App Store in 2014. This inference is supported by the consistent pattern of faster growth in Google Play’s app volume during this period, driven by its open ecosystem and broader Android device adoption [rag-3]. The 100,000+ app gap observed in 2015 did not emerge abruptly; it was the cumulative result of prior-year advantages, making it highly improbable that Apple overtook Google in 2014.

However, despite this robust inference, **no official or verifiable figures for the exact number of apps in either store during 2014 exist within the available data sources**. Public records, industry reports, and platform disclosures from that year do not provide precise counts, and no tool or search has yielded such data. Therefore, while we can confidently state that Google Play Store likely had more apps in 2014, the specific number in millions remains unknown and cannot be reported with precision.

### Summary
Google Play Store almost certainly led the Apple App Store in app count in 2014, based on 2015 trends and growth dynamics, but the exact number of apps for either store in 2014 is unavailable and cannot be determined from existing sources.
