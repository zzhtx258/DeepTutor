## S1: Analysis of Vietnam’s iOS 9 Adoption Rate Availability and Comparability

To determine whether Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate as of Q3 2015 is higher or lower than the global average, we must first establish whether country-specific data for Vietnam exists in the available materials. The global iOS 9 adoption rate as of September 19, 2015 (within Q3 2015) is documented as **51%** [rag-1]. However, no source provides a breakdown of iOS 9 adoption rates by individual countries, including Vietnam, for that quarter.

While it is noted that Vietnam’s overall iOS market share was **31%** in Q3 2015 [rag-2], this figure represents the total usage of all iOS versions combined—not specifically iOS 9. There is no information indicating what proportion of that 31% had upgraded to iOS 9 during the same period. Without this specific metric, any attempt to compare Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate with the global average of 51% would be speculative.

Therefore, based on the current evidence, **a direct comparison between Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate and the global average is not possible** due to the absence of country-level iOS 9 adoption statistics for Vietnam in Q3 2015.

In summary, while the global benchmark is known, Vietnam’s specific iOS 9 adoption rate remains undocumented in the provided materials, rendering the requested percentage difference uncalculable at this stage.

## S2: Clarification on Data Availability and Definition of Metrics

As established in the prior step, there is no available data that specifies Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate for Q3 2015. The global iOS 9 adoption rate as of September 19, 2015 — a date falling within Q3 2015 — is documented at **51%** [rag-1]. However, this figure represents an aggregate across all regions and does not include country-level granularity.

It is critical to distinguish between two distinct metrics:

- **iOS 9 Adoption Rate**: The percentage of devices running iOS 9 specifically during a given period.
- **Overall iOS Market Share**: The percentage of devices running *any* version of iOS (e.g., iOS 7, 8, or 9) relative to all mobile operating systems in a region.

Vietnam’s reported **31% iOS market share** in Q3 2015 [rag-2] refers to the latter — it encompasses all iOS versions combined. This value cannot be interpreted as the adoption rate of iOS 9 alone. Without knowing what proportion of those 31% had upgraded to iOS 9 by September 2015, we cannot derive Vietnam’s specific iOS 9 adoption rate.

Consequently, any attempt to calculate the difference between Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate and the global average of 51% would require assumptions not supported by the available materials. Since no source provides a country-specific breakdown of iOS 9 adoption for Vietnam — nor any methodology to estimate it from the 31% figure — the requested percentage difference remains **uncomputable**.

In summary, while the global benchmark is known, Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate for Q3 2015 is not documented in the provided materials. The 31% figure reflects total iOS usage, not iOS 9 specifically, and therefore cannot serve as a substitute for the missing metric.

    No direct comparison is available for Vietnam's iOS 9 adoption rate versus the global average as of Q3 2015. The global iOS 9 adoption was 51% as of September 19, 2015 (within Q3), and 13% for the quarter overall. Vietnam’s iOS market share was 31% in Q3 2015, but this includes all iOS versions, not specifically iOS 9. No country-level breakdown of iOS 9 adoption is provided in the available data.
