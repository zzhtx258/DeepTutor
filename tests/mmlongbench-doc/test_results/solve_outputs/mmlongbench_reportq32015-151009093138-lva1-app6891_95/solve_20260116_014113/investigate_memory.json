This chart does not break down adoption by country.\n*   **Vietnam-Specific Data:** While the context contains extensive data on the Vietnamese mobile market for Q3 2015 (including overall iOS market share at 31%, smartphone usage patterns, and popular apps), it does not provide a specific breakdown of iOS 9 adoption *within Vietnam* for that quarter.\n\nTherefore, the complete data/numbers for iOS 9 adoption rates by country or region as requested are not available in the provided context.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Q3 2015 Mobile Market Report\n- [2] iOS Version Adoption Pie Chart as of September 19, 2015 (image)\n- [3] iOS Version Adoption Comparison Chart Q2 vs Q3 2015 (image)\n- [4] Vietnam Smartphone OS Market Share and 3G Speed Comparison Chart (image)",
