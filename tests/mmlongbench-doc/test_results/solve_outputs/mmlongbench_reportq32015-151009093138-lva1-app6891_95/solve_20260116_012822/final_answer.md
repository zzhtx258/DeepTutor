## S1: Global Developer Mindshare Comparison Between Java and WP (Windows Phone)

To address the question of the difference in global developer mindshare between **Java** and **WP**, it is first essential to clarify the meaning of “WP” in this context. Based on available data, “WP” refers exclusively to **Windows Phone**, the mobile operating system developed by Microsoft, and **not** WordPress, the content management system [rag-1]. This distinction is critical, as no comparative data exists between Java and WordPress in terms of developer mindshare.

From the provided materials, we extract the following precise percentages:

- **Java**: Holds a global developer mindshare of **19.8%**.
- **Windows Phone (WP)**: Holds a global developer mindshare of **2.3%**.

The absolute difference in percentage points between the two is calculated as:

$$
19.8\% - 2.3\% = 17.5\%
$$

Thus, Java’s global developer mindshare exceeds that of Windows Phone by **17.5 percentage points**.

This significant gap reflects the broader industry adoption and sustained relevance of Java across enterprise, mobile (Android), and backend development ecosystems, while Windows Phone has seen declining developer interest following Microsoft’s discontinuation of active development for the platform.

No visual charts or tables were generated or referenced in this step, as all necessary data was directly available in textual form.

In summary, the global developer mindshare for Java is 19.8%, for Windows Phone (WP) it is 2.3%, and the difference between them is exactly 17.5 percentage points — with “WP” unambiguously referring to Windows Phone, not WordPress.

## S2: Calculation of Percentage Point Difference Between Java and WP

To compute the percentage point difference between **Java** (19.8%) and **Windows Phone (WP)** (2.3%), we perform a direct subtraction of their respective global developer mindshare percentages:

$$
\Delta = 19.8\% - 2.3\% = 17.5\%
$$

This result, **17.5 percentage points**, represents the absolute gap in developer mindshare between the two platforms. It is important to note that this is not a relative percentage change but a simple arithmetic difference in percentage points — a standard metric for comparing proportions in survey or market share data [rag-1].

The value `17.5` has been independently verified through both textual extraction from available materials and computational validation via tool execution, confirming its accuracy without ambiguity.

No visual aids or additional tables are required for this step, as the calculation is straightforward and relies solely on explicitly provided numerical values.

In summary, the difference in global developer mindshare between Java and Windows Phone is precisely **17.5 percentage points**, with Java holding significantly greater developer attention globally.
