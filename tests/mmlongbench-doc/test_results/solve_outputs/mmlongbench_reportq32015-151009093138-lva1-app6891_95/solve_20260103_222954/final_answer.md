## S1: Analysis of App Rankings on the Appota Platform in Vietnam

In evaluating the available knowledge regarding the ranking of apps on the Appota platform in Vietnam, it is important to note that there is currently insufficient information to identify the app that ranks 15th among Android applications. The resources consulted indicate that the context primarily provides details about the top 10 most downloaded mobile games in Vietnam as of Q3 2015, without extending to a comprehensive list that includes the 15th ranked app or beyond.

The repeated findings across various queries confirm that the available data does not specify individual app rankings beyond the top 10. Consequently, we cannot ascertain which app holds the 15th position on the Appota platform for Android in Vietnam at this time. This limitation highlights a gap in the current knowledge base regarding app rankings on this platform.

In summary, while we have established that the Appota platform does provide rankings for popular apps, the specific details regarding the 15th ranked app remain elusive due to a lack of available data. Further research or updated resources may be necessary to obtain this information.

## S2: Conclusion on the 15th Ranked App on the Appota Platform

In our analysis of the app rankings on the Appota platform in Vietnam, we have reached a definitive conclusion regarding the identification of the app that ranks 15th among Android applications. Despite thorough exploration of available resources, it has become clear that there is insufficient information to ascertain which app holds this specific position.

The findings consistently indicate that the data available primarily focuses on the top 10 most downloaded mobile games, leaving a gap in the information regarding rankings beyond this threshold. As a result, we are unable to provide the name or details of the app that ranks 15th on the Appota platform for Android in Vietnam.

This limitation underscores the need for further research or updated resources to fill this knowledge gap. Consequently, we conclude that without additional data, the identification of the 15th ranked app remains unresolved.
