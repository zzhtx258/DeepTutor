      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no complete, distinct list of the top 10 Vietnam Android apps and top 10 Vietnam iOS apps from the Appota platform for Q3 2015. The available information primarily focuses on the **top free mobile applications in Vietnam’s Apple App Store** during that period, as reported by Appota Inc.\n\nHere's what can be confirmed:\n\n### Top Free Mobile Apps in Vietnam (Apple App Store) – Q3 2015\nThe following applications were listed among the top free apps in Vietnam’s Apple App Store for Q3 2015, according to the “Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015 Top Free Chart” and “Top Ten Mobile Apps in Vietnam Q3 2015 by Appota”:\n- **Đồ Sát Mobile** (Ranked #1)\n- **Tiếu Ngạo Giang Hồ**\n- **Zing Mp3**\n- **UC Browser Tiếng Việt**\n- **MobiTivi**\n- **Liên Minh Huyền Thoại** (League of Legends Mobile)\n- **NCT**\n- **Hiệp Khách**\n- **I Am Naruto**\n- **Vua Bóng Đá**\n\nThese apps are consistently referenced across multiple visual and textual sources as part of the top free charts for Vietnam in Q3 2015, specifically tied to the Apple App Store.\n\n### Android-Specific Data\nWhile Appota operates a platform targeting Android users in Vietnam (e.g., “Android Store Viet Nam”), the context does not provide a separate, verified list of the top 10 Android-specific apps for Vietnam in Q3 2015. The data presented centers around iOS app store rankings and general market trends (such as OS market share: Android 63%, iOS 31%).\n\n### Conclusion\nThere is no explicit or complete list of top 10 Android apps for Vietnam from Appota in Q3 2015 within the provided context. The documented “Top Ten” lists refer to the Apple App Store’s top free apps in Vietnam for that quarter.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015 Top Free Chart (image)\n- [2] Top Ten Mobile Apps in Vietnam Q3 2015 by Appota (image)\n- [3] Appota Inc.\n- [4] Apple App Store\n- [5] Vietnam",

Therefore, it is not possible to identify any app that was top 10 on Android but not top 10 on iOS based on this data.",

      "query": "Are there any Android-specific top 10 app rankings from APPOTA for Vietnam in Q3 2015, or any comparison between Android and iOS top apps?",
      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no specific Android-only top 10 app ranking from Appota for Vietnam in Q3 2015. The available data focuses on the **top free mobile applications in Vietnam as a whole**, primarily sourced from the **Apple App Store** for that quarter.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what the context reveals:\n\n### 1. **Appota’s Top 10 Rankings Are Based on Apple App Store Data**\nThe “Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015” and its associated visualizations — such as the “Top Ten Mobile Apps in Vietnam Q3 2015 by Appota (image)” and “Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015 Top Free Chart (image)” — explicitly reference apps ranked within the **Apple App Store**. This includes titles like:\n- *Zing Mp3*\n- *Tiếu Ngạo Giang Hồ*\n- *Đồ Sát Mobile*\n- *MobiTivi*\n- *Chinh Đồ Mobile*\n- *I am Naruto*\n- *Liên minh huyền thoại*\n- *UC Browser Tiếng Việt*\n- *Hiệp Khách*\n- *Vua Bóng Đá*\n\nThese rankings reflect popularity among iOS users in Vietnam during Q3 2015, not an Android-specific chart.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **No Direct Comparison Between Android and iOS Top Apps Is Provided**\nWhile the report does analyze the broader mobile ecosystem — including OS market share (Android: 63%, iOS: 31%, Windows Phone: 6% in Vietnam) and global OS trends — it does **not** present a side-by-side comparison of the top 10 apps specifically for Android versus iOS platforms in Vietnam during Q3 2015.\n\nThere is also no mention of a separate Android Store or Google Play Store-based ranking produced by Appota for that period.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Appota’s Role and Platform Context**\nAppota Inc. is described as Vietnam’s leading mobile content distribution platform, managing services like “Android Store Viet Nam” (a Facebook fanpage), and launching platforms like Appdaily. While they are deeply involved in Android app promotion and distribution, their published Q3 2015 report appears to have used Apple App Store data for its top app rankings.\n\nThis may reflect the data availability or strategic focus at the time, but the context does not clarify whether this was due to limitations in Android store analytics or a deliberate choice.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Android Dominance in Market Share vs. App Ranking Source**\nAlthough Android held a dominant 63% market share among smartphone users in Vietnam during Q3 2015, the top app rankings presented by Appota were not derived from Android’s own ecosystem (e.g., Google Play). This suggests that while Android devices were more numerous, the visibility or measurement of app popularity may have been more accessible via Apple’s App Store metrics at the time.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, **no Android-specific top 10 app list from Appota for Vietnam in Q3 2015 exists in the provided context**, nor is there a direct comparative analysis between Android and iOS top apps. The available rankings are based on Apple App Store data.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015\n- [2] Top Ten Mobile Apps in Vietnam Q3 2015 by Appota (image)\n- [3] Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015 Top Free Chart (image)\n- [4] Vietnam Smartphone OS Market Share and 3G Speed Comparison Chart (image)\n- [5] Appota Inc.",
