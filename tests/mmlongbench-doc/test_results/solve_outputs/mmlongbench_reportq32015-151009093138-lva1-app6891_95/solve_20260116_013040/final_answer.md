## S1: Analysis of APPOTA Platform App Rankings by Platform (Android vs. iOS)

To determine whether any app on the APPOTA platform ranks in the top 10 Vietnam Android apps but not in the top 10 Vietnam iOS apps, we must examine whether comparative platform-specific rankings are available for Q3 2015 — the most recent period for which Appota published such data.

### Conceptual Clarification

The term “top 10 Vietnam Android App” implies a ranking derived from Android-specific metrics (e.g., Google Play Store downloads or usage in Vietnam), while “top 10 Vietnam iOS App” refers to rankings based on Apple App Store performance in Vietnam. For an app to satisfy the query’s condition, it must appear in the former list but be absent from the latter — requiring both lists to exist and be comparable.

However, according to the available materials, **Appota’s Q3 2015 report does not provide separate Android and iOS rankings**. Instead, it presents a consolidated list of top free mobile applications in Vietnam, primarily sourced from the Apple App Store [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3]. While Android held 63% market share in Vietnam during that period, Appota did not derive its top app list from Google Play or Android store metrics [rag-3].

### Logical Derivation

We can logically deduce the following:

1. The only available ranking data is for iOS (Apple App Store) — e.g., Đồ Sát Mobile, Zing Mp3, UC Browser Tiếng Việt — with no corresponding Android-specific top 10 list provided by Appota [rag-2].
2. Without an Android-specific ranking, it is impossible to identify which apps were top 10 on Android.
3. Without both lists, we cannot perform a set difference operation to find apps that are top 10 on Android but not on iOS.
4. Even if we assume some apps may have been more popular on Android due to its larger market share, no empirical data supports this assumption within the Appota ecosystem for Q3 2015.

Therefore, based strictly on the evidence provided, **no app can be identified as meeting the condition** of being top 10 on Vietnam Android but not top 10 on Vietnam iOS via the APPOTA platform.

### Conclusion

There is insufficient data to answer the question. The available materials do not contain a distinct Android-specific top 10 ranking from APPOTA for Vietnam in Q3 2015, nor do they provide a comparative analysis between Android and iOS app rankings on the platform. As such, it is not possible to identify any APPOTA platform app that satisfies the specified condition.

This conclusion is supported by all three RAG results and the tool execution summary, which unanimously state that the necessary comparative data does not exist in the provided context [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3].

    The provided result does not explicitly identify any app that is top 10 in Vietnam for Android but not top 10 for iOS on the APPOTA platform. It lists the Top Ten Mobile Apps in Vietnam Q3 2015 (including both Android and iOS), such as Đồ Sát Mobile, Chinh Đồ Mobile, MobiTivi, and others — but does not separate rankings by platform or indicate which apps are exclusive to Android. The report focuses on overall popularity across both platforms, and no data confirms an app that ranks top 10 on Android but not on iOS within the APPOTA ecosystem.

    No complete list of top 10 Vietnam Android apps from APPOTA for Q3 2015 is available in the provided result. The documented top 10 apps (e.g., Đồ Sát Mobile, Zing Mp3, UC Browser Tiếng Việt) are specifically from the Apple App Store (iOS), not Android. While Appota operates an Android platform, no separate Android-specific top 10 ranking is provided. Therefore, it is not possible to identify any app that was top 10 on Android but not top 10 on iOS based on this data.

    Are there any Android-specific top 10 app rankings from APPOTA for Vietnam in Q3 2015, or any comparison between Android and iOS top apps?
    ```
  - Citation Content:
    ```
    No Android-specific top 10 app ranking from Appota for Vietnam in Q3 2015 is available in the provided context. The published rankings are based solely on Apple App Store data and do not include a comparative list of top Android apps versus iOS apps. While Android held 63% market share in Vietnam during that period, Appota’s report did not derive its top app list from Google Play or Android store metrics. Therefore, it is not possible to identify any APP on the APPOTA platform that was top 10 in Vietnam for Android but not for iOS based on this data.
