      "raw_result": "As of Q3 2015, Appota’s Facebook fanpage, known as **Android Store Viet Nam**, had grown to become the **largest Vietnamese tech community on Facebook**. While the exact number of fans is not specified in the provided context, its status as the largest tech community in Vietnam at that time indicates a substantial and leading user base within the country’s social media landscape.\n\nThis achievement reflects Appota’s strong engagement with the local tech audience and its role in distributing mobile content across Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam, where it targeted approximately 18 million smartphone users during that period.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Appota\n- [2] Android Store Viet Nam",
      "summary": "As of Q3 2015, Appota’s Facebook fanpage (Android Store Viet Nam) was the largest Vietnamese tech community on Facebook, indicating a very large fan base — though the exact number is not provided. The result does not mention Instagram user counts in Vietnam for that period, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, since the question requires a direct answer and Appota’s fan page is explicitly highlighted as the largest tech community at that time, the most reasonable inference based on available data is 'Appota'.",
