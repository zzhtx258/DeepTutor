## Detailed Answer

## S1: Comparative Analysis of User Base — Instagram vs. Appota (Q3 2015)

To determine whether there were more active Instagram users in Vietnam or more fans for Appota’s fan page as of Q3 2015, we must evaluate the available quantitative and qualitative data.

### Quantitative Benchmark: Instagram Users
As of Q3 2015, Vietnam had approximately **700,000 active Instagram users** [rag-1]. This is a concrete, measurable figure representing the total user base on the platform within the country during that quarter.

### Qualitative Benchmark: Appota’s Fan Page
Appota’s Facebook fanpage, known as “Android Store Viet Nam,” was explicitly described as the **largest Vietnamese tech community on Facebook** as of Q3 2015 [rag-2]. While no exact number of fans is provided, this designation implies a substantial and dominant presence within its niche — likely exceeding typical community sizes for tech-focused pages in Vietnam at that time.

### Inference and Reasoning
Although we lack an exact fan count for Appota, the phrase “largest Vietnamese tech community on Facebook” carries significant contextual weight. In Q3 2015, Facebook was far more widely adopted in Vietnam than Instagram — with millions of active users overall — and tech communities often attracted tens or even hundreds of thousands of followers due to high engagement around mobile apps, games, and gadgets.

Given that:
- Instagram’s entire active user base in Vietnam was 700,000,
- Appota’s fan page was the *largest* tech community on Facebook (a much larger platform),
- And tech communities typically attract highly engaged, concentrated followings,

It is reasonable to infer that Appota’s fan base likely exceeded 700,000 — especially since being “the largest” suggests it outperformed other major tech pages, which themselves would have had substantial followings.

Thus, based on contextual prominence and platform scale, **Appota** is the more probable answer.
