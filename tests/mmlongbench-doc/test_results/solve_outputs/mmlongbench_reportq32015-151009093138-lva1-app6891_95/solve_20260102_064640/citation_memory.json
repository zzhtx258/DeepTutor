      "raw_result": "In Q3 2015, the cost per install (CPI) for non-incentive mobile advertising in Vietnam ranged between 0.3 and 0.4 Vietnamese Đồng (VND), as indicated by market data visualized in infographics from the Appota Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015. However, the report does not explicitly state the CPI for incentive reward platforms, which are distinct from non-incentive models. Incentive reward platforms in Vietnam were characterized by rapid growth during this period, with each platform provider delivering approximately 5,000 to 20,000 installs per day, driven by user rewards such as in-app currency or digital goods.\n\nWhile the exact CPI for incentive ads is not quantified in the provided context, the distinction between non-incentive and incentive models is clearly made, implying that incentive CPIs may differ due to the added cost of user rewards. The report notes that incentive reward platforms were booming, suggesting a competitive and possibly higher-cost model compared to non-incentive ads. Conversion costs for incentive ads are typically higher than non-incentive ones because they include the value of the reward offered to users, even though the direct monetary cost per install in VND is not specified.\n\nTo convert the non-incentive CPI range (0.3–0.4 VND) to USD, we use the approximate exchange rate in Q3 2015: 1 USD ≈ 21,000 VND. This yields a non-incentive CPI of approximately $0.000014 to $0.000019 USD. However, since incentive CPIs are not directly reported, and the reward component is not monetized in the data provided, a precise USD figure for incentive platform CPI cannot be derived from the available context.\n\nThus, while the non-incentive CPI is documented in VND and can be converted to USD, the incentive platform CPI remains unspecified in both VND and USD terms within the provided material.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
