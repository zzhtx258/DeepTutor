      "step_response": "## S1: Assessing Data Sufficiency for Daily Cost Estimation\n\nTo determine whether the available knowledge permits estimation of the daily cost range (in USD) of a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam for installations during Q3 2015, we must evaluate the presence and relevance of quantitative data on incentive-based cost-per-install (CPI) metrics. The available materials explicitly distinguish between non-incentive and incentive CPI models [rag-1]. While non-incentive CPI in Vietnam during this period is documented at 0.3–0.4 VND per install—equivalent to approximately $0.000014–$0.000019 USD—this figure applies only to non-rewarded, organic user acquisition channels [rag-1]. \n\nMobile incentive platforms, by definition, involve direct user compensation such as in-app currency, gift cards, or cash rewards, which significantly increase acquisition costs compared to non-incentive models. However, the Appota Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015, the sole source cited, does not report any numerical values, ranges, or even indicative benchmarks for incentive-based CPI in Vietnam during this timeframe [rag-1]. Furthermore, no supplementary tool results, datasets, or external references are provided to bridge this gap. Without data on the volume of incentivized installs per day, or the average reward value per install, it is mathematically and statistically impossible to derive a daily cost range in USD.\n\nThus, despite the availability of baseline non-incentive CPI data, the absence of any quantified incentive CPI figures renders the estimation of daily costs for mobile incentive platforms infeasible with the current knowledge base.\n\nThe available materials do not provide sufficient data to estimate the daily cost range of a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam for installations in Q3 2015.",
