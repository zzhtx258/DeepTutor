According to the available materials, no specific figures for iOS 7 adoption in Vietnam during Q3 2015 are recorded [rag-1]. While the sources do reference broader iOS market trends—such as iOS 9 achieving over 50% adoption on iOS devices by September 19, 2015, and accounting for 42% of the mobile OS market share in Q3 2015—they do not break down adoption rates by individual iOS versions for Vietnam, nor do they provide historical data for iOS 7 in that region or time period [rag-1].\n\nFurthermore, no tool execution or external data source has yielded supplementary statistics on iOS 7 usage in Vietnam during this timeframe. Without access to either country-specific iOS version distribution data or global benchmarks for iOS 7 in Q3 2015, it is not possible to compute a comparative percentage difference between Vietnam and the global average.\n\nIn summary, the absence of granular, time-specific, and geographically targeted data on iOS 7 adoption renders any quantitative comparison infeasible. The question cannot be answered with the current information.\n\nThe data required to answer the original question—Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate relative to the global average in Q3 2015—is not available in the provided knowledge base.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Analysis of Global iOS 7 Adoption Rate in Q3 2015\n\nTo evaluate whether Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate can be meaningfully compared to the global average, it is essential to first establish whether the global baseline for iOS 7 adoption in Q3 2015 exists within the available data. According to the knowledge base, no figures for iOS 7 adoption—neither globally nor in Vietnam—are documented for this period [rag-2]. While the materials confirm that iOS 9 had achieved over 50% adoption on iOS devices by September 19, 2015, and accounted for 42% of the mobile OS market share in Q3 2015, these metrics pertain exclusively to iOS 9 and do not retroactively inform the usage share of iOS 7 during the same quarter [rag-1].\n\nFurthermore, the tool execution results explicitly state: “As of Q3 2015, there is no available data on the global iOS 7 adoption rate or Vietnam's iOS 7 adoption rate” [rag_naive]. This absence is not a gap in granularity but a complete lack of recorded metrics for iOS 7 in this timeframe. Without a quantified global adoption rate for iOS 7, it is mathematically and statistically impossible to compute a difference—whether positive or negative—between Vietnam and the global average, even if Vietnam’s rate were known.\n\nThe data chain is therefore incomplete at its foundational level: neither the numerator (Vietnam’s rate) nor the denominator (global rate) for the proposed comparison is available. Any attempt to infer or estimate iOS 7’s global adoption rate from iOS 9’s growth trajectory would constitute speculative extrapolation, violating the principle of evidence-based analysis.\n\nIn summary, the global iOS 7 adoption rate for Q3 2015 is not documented in any of the provided sources, rendering comparative analysis infeasible.",

While the knowledge base contains information on the rapid adoption of iOS 9—specifically noting that over 50% of iOS devices were running iOS 9 by September 19, 2015, and that iOS 9 accounted for 42% of the mobile OS market share in Q3 2015—there is no mention of iOS 7 usage at any level, whether aggregated globally or disaggregated by region [rag-1]. \n\nThis absence is not a matter of insufficient granularity or delayed reporting; it is a complete lack of recorded metrics for iOS 7 adoption in Q3 2015. Without a quantified baseline for the global adoption rate, it is impossible to establish a denominator for comparison. Similarly, without any data on Vietnam’s iOS 7 usage, there is no numerator to evaluate. Any attempt to infer iOS 7’s adoption rate from iOS 9’s growth trajectory would require assumptions about user upgrade patterns, device lifecycles, or regional software update behaviors—none of which are supported by the evidence provided.\n\nTherefore, the question of whether Vietnam’s iOS 7 adoption rate was higher or lower than the global average, and by how much, is unanswerable with the current dataset. The required data for both the numerator and denominator of the comparison is fundamentally missing.\n\nIn summary, the comparison is not merely unsupported—it is mathematically and logically infeasible due to the complete absence of iOS 7 adoption data for both Vietnam and the global market in Q3 2015.",
