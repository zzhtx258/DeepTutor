To address this, we must first assess whether such a pie chart exists in the available data and, if not, whether the required percentage can be inferred from alternative reliable sources.\n\nAccording to the provided knowledge base, no dedicated pie chart illustrating the global iOS version breakdown—specifically showing the distribution of iOS 9 relative to other iOS versions such as iOS 8, iOS 10, etc.—has been found [rag-1]. While visualizations exist for broader mobile OS market shares (e.g., iOS 9 accounting for 42% of the total smartphone OS market including Android), these are not relevant to the internal iOS version distribution [rag-1][rag-2].\n\nHowever, a critical piece of evidence emerges from Apple’s official App Store data: as of September 19, 2015, iOS 9 accounted for **over 50% of all iOS devices in use** [rag-2]. This figure reflects the proportion of iOS 9 within the iOS ecosystem itself, not the broader mobile market. It is derived from active device usage metrics and represents the most accurate available estimate of iOS 9’s dominance among iOS versions at its peak adoption [rag-2].\n\nTherefore, while a pie chart visualizing this breakdown does not exist in the available materials, the underlying data necessary to answer the question is present. The percentage of iOS 9 in the global iOS version breakdown is **greater than 50%**, based on Apple’s reported device adoption statistics.\n\nIn summary, although no pie chart is available, the requested percentage can be reliably determined from authoritative source data: iOS 9 represented over 50% of active iOS devices as of September 2015.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Interpretation of iOS 9’s Share Within the iOS Ecosystem vs. Total Mobile OS Market\n\nTo accurately answer the question regarding the percentage of iOS 9 in the *global iOS version breakdown*, it is essential to distinguish between two fundamentally different metrics: **iOS-only version distribution** and **total smartphone OS market share**. These are often conflated in public reports, but they represent entirely different reference populations.\n\nThe **iOS-only version breakdown** refers to the proportion of active iOS devices running each version of the iOS operating system—i.e., among all iPhones, iPads, and iPods using iOS, what fraction were running iOS 9? This metric isolates the internal ecosystem of Apple’s own operating system and is the only relevant measure for answering the user’s query about a “pie chart of iOS version breakdown” [rag-2].\n\nAccording to Apple’s official App Store data as of September 19, 2015, **iOS 9 accounted for over 50% of all iOS devices in use** [rag-2]. This figure reflects the cumulative adoption rate of iOS 9 across the entire installed base of iOS devices at the time of its release, indicating that more than half of all iOS users had upgraded to iOS 9 within just a few months of its launch—a remarkable adoption velocity for a mobile OS update [rag-2].\n\nIn contrast, the **42% figure** cited in some sources refers to iOS 9’s share of the *total global smartphone operating system market*, which includes Android, Windows Phone, and other platforms [rag-2]. In Q3 2015, Android dominated the overall market with approximately 80% share, meaning iOS as a whole held roughly 18–20% of the total smartphone OS market. Within that 18–20%, iOS 9 constituted the majority—hence, 42% of the *entire* smartphone market was attributable to iOS 9 devices. This is not a breakdown of iOS versions, but rather a slice of a much larger pie that includes competitors [rag-2].\n\nThus, the **most relevant percentage** for the user’s question—about iOS 9’s share *within the iOS ecosystem*—is unequivocally **over 50%**. The 42% figure, while frequently cited in broader market analyses, is misleading in this context because it conflates iOS with Android and other platforms. Only the 50%+ figure accurately represents the internal distribution of iOS versions.\n\nThis distinction is critical for data literacy: when analyzing version adoption, one must always clarify whether the denominator is “all smartphones” or “all iOS devices.” Apple’s internal metrics, being source-truthed and device-specific, provide the authoritative answer for iOS version breakdowns.\n\nIn summary, iOS 9 represented over 50% of active iOS devices as of September 2015, making it the dominant version within the iOS ecosystem. The 42% figure pertains to the broader mobile OS market and is not applicable to an iOS-only breakdown.",

This figure represents the most accurate and authoritative estimate of iOS 9’s penetration within the iOS ecosystem itself, making it the definitive answer to the question regarding its percentage in a global iOS version breakdown. As the dominant version during its peak adoption period, iOS 9 surpassed all other iOS versions combined, reflecting an unprecedented upgrade velocity for a mobile operating system [rag-2].\n\nHowever, this data is inherently time-bound and context-limited. It captures a snapshot from late 2015, shortly after iOS 9’s release, and does not reflect subsequent version distributions (e.g., iOS 10, iOS 11, or later). No longitudinal data or updated pie charts are available in the provided materials to extend this analysis beyond that date. Furthermore, while the 42% figure is frequently cited in broader mobile market reports, it refers to iOS 9’s share of the *total smartphone OS market* (including Android and others), not the internal iOS version distribution, and must not be confused with the correct metric [rag-2].\n\nThus, while we cannot provide a visual pie chart due to the absence of such a visualization in the source materials, we can confidently state the underlying quantitative truth: **iOS 9 represented more than 50% of active iOS devices as of September 2015**, and this remains the only reliable, source-backed percentage for the requested iOS version breakdown.\n\nIn summary, the percentage of iOS 9 in the global iOS version breakdown is **over 50%**, grounded in Apple’s own device adoption data, with clear temporal and contextual boundaries.",
