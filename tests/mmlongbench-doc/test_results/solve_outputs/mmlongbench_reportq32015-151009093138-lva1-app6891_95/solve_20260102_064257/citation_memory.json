While multiple charts and textual references confirm that iOS 9 achieved rapid adoption—with over 50% of devices using iOS 9 as of September 19, 2015, according to Apple’s App Store measurement—there is no visual representation in the form of a pie chart that breaks down global iOS versions (e.g., iOS 9 vs. iOS 8 vs. older versions).\n\nThe closest visual evidence is a horizontal bar chart titled \"Mobile OS Market Share by Quarter (Q3 2015)\" (reference_id: 1), which shows iOS 9 at 42% of the total mobile OS market share, but this reflects its share among all mobile operating systems (including Android, Windows Phone, etc.), not the internal breakdown of iOS versions. Another bar chart titled \"Smartphone OS Market Share by Quarter (Q3 2015)\" also lists iOS 9 at 42%, but again, this is market share against all smartphone OSes, not a pie chart of iOS version distribution.\n\nNo document chunk describes or depicts a pie chart isolating the global iOS version segmentation.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The provided context includes multiple visualizations related to mobile operating system market shares in Q3 2015, but none of the documents contain a pie chart specifically depicting the global iOS version breakdown. However, several sources confirm that iOS 9 had an exceptionally high adoption rate during this period.\n\nAccording to the textual context in the report, iOS 9 achieved the fastest adoption rate ever, with more than 50 percent of devices already using iOS 9 as of September 19, 2015, based on Apple’s measurement from the App Store. This figure is corroborated by a bar chart titled \"Mobile OS Market Share by Quarter (Q3 2015)\" (reference_id: 1), which shows iOS 9 accounting for 42% of the overall mobile OS market share. Another bar chart titled \"Smartphone OS Market Share by Quarter (Q3 2015)\" (reference_id: 1) also lists iOS 9 at 42%, indicating its dominance among iOS versions at that time.\n\nWhile these charts represent iOS 9’s share of the total smartphone OS market (not a breakdown of iOS versions alone), they strongly suggest that iOS 9 constituted the overwhelming majority of iOS devices in use, given that iOS 8 and earlier versions were rapidly being phased out. No other iOS version percentages are quantified in the context, and no pie chart isolating iOS version distribution is described.\n\nThus, while a dedicated pie chart for iOS version breakdown is not present in the provided materials, the data consistently supports that iOS 9 represented over 50% of iOS devices and 42% of the total smartphone OS market in Q3 2015.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
