However, it does mention that iOS 9 had the fastest adoption rate ever, with more than 50 percent of devices already using it as of September 2015, but specific figures for iOS 7 are absent.\n\nFor global trends, the context indicates that iOS saw a decline in market share during Q2 2015, dropping to approximately 22.3% QoQ. Nevertheless, a direct comparison to the adoption rate of iOS 7 is not available.\n\nTherefore, I do not have enough information to answer your query about the adoption rate of iOS 7 in Vietnam specifically compared to the global average for Q3 2015.",
