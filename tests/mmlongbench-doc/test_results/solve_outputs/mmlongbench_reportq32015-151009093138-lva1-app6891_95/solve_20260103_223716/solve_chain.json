According to the available materials, there are no records or statistics that detail the adoption rate of iOS 7 in Vietnam during this period, nor is there data to facilitate a comparison with the global average adoption rate for the same version of the operating system.\n\nThe summaries from the knowledge base explicitly state that the information required to ascertain whether Vietnam's adoption rate of iOS 7 was higher or lower than the global average is not available. This is corroborated by multiple queries, all leading to the conclusion that the absence of specific figures prevents any meaningful analysis or calculation of the percentage difference between Vietnam's rate and the global average rate for iOS 7 adoption in Q3 2015. \n\nIn summary, without the necessary data, it is impossible to determine Vietnam's iOS 7 adoption rate or to compare it with global trends, leaving us unable to provide any percentage difference.",

The available materials indicate that no records or statistics are present to provide insight into Vietnam's adoption rate during this period. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain whether this rate is higher or lower than the global average adoption rate for iOS 7.\n\nAs a result, it is also impossible to calculate the percentage difference between Vietnam's adoption rate and the global average. The absence of necessary figures precludes any meaningful comparison or analysis. Thus, we conclude that without the requisite data, we cannot determine Vietnam's iOS 7 adoption rate relative to global trends, nor can we provide any percentage difference. \n\nIn summary, the lack of specific information renders it impossible to draw any conclusions regarding Vietnam's iOS 7 adoption rate in comparison to the global average.",
