This statistic indicates a relatively small segment of the developer community engaged with WP. However, the data concerning Java developers is notably absent. Multiple sources confirm that there is insufficient information available to determine how many developers identify as Java developers or what percentage of the global developer community they represent. This lack of data makes it impossible to draw a direct comparison or calculate a percentage difference between the two platforms.\n\nGiven the absence of specific figures for Java, we cannot accurately assess the mindshare difference between Java and WP. The only conclusion we can draw from the current data is that WP has a defined but limited presence in the developer landscape, while the mindshare for Java remains undefined and unquantified at this time.\n\nIn summary, without specific data for Java developers, we cannot establish a meaningful percentage difference in global developers' mindshare between Java and Windows Phone. The only available statistic is the 2% representation of WP developers, leaving a gap in our analysis for Java.",

This absence of data for Java prevents us from calculating a meaningful percentage difference in global developers' mindshare between the two platforms.\n\nTo summarize, the only statistic we possess is the 2% representation of WP developers, which highlights a limited engagement with this platform.
