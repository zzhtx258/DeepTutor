## S1: Analysis of Developer Mindshare Between Java and Windows Phone

To evaluate the difference in global developers' mindshare between Java and Windows Phone (WP), we must first examine the available data regarding the percentage of developers identifying with each platform. 

Currently, the only concrete figure we have is that just over 2% of developers identify as Windows Phone developers. This statistic indicates a relatively small segment of the developer community engaged with WP. However, the data concerning Java developers is notably absent. Multiple sources confirm that there is insufficient information available to determine how many developers identify as Java developers or what percentage of the global developer community they represent. This lack of data makes it impossible to draw a direct comparison or calculate a percentage difference between the two platforms.

Given the absence of specific figures for Java, we cannot accurately assess the mindshare difference between Java and WP. The only conclusion we can draw from the current data is that WP has a defined but limited presence in the developer landscape, while the mindshare for Java remains undefined and unquantified at this time.

In summary, without specific data for Java developers, we cannot establish a meaningful percentage difference in global developers' mindshare between Java and Windows Phone. The only available statistic is the 2% representation of WP developers, leaving a gap in our analysis for Java.

## S2: Conclusion on Developer Mindshare Difference

In our analysis of the developer mindshare between Java and Windows Phone (WP), we have established that there is a significant gap in the available data necessary for a comprehensive comparison. While we know that over 2% of developers identify as Windows Phone developers, we lack any concrete figures regarding the percentage of developers associated with Java. This absence of data for Java prevents us from calculating a meaningful percentage difference in global developers' mindshare between the two platforms.

To summarize, the only statistic we possess is the 2% representation of WP developers, which highlights a limited engagement with this platform. In contrast, the mindshare for Java remains undefined and unquantified, leaving us unable to draw any conclusions regarding the relative standing of Java compared to WP. Therefore, we conclude that there is insufficient information to calculate the percentage difference in global developers' mindshare between Java and Windows Phone.
