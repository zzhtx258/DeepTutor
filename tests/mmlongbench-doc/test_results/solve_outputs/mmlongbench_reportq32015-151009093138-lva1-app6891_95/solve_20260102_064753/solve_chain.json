This figure reflects the proportion of iOS devices in Vietnam running iOS 9 during the third quarter of 2015. In comparison, Apple publicly stated that the global adoption rate of iOS 9 had surpassed **50%** as of September 19, 2015 — a key benchmark date within Q3 2015 [rag-1]. \n\nThe comparison is direct and unambiguous: Vietnam’s adoption rate of 42% is lower than the global average of over 50%. The difference between these two values exceeds 8 percentage points, as explicitly noted in the available data [rag-1]. This indicates that, despite iOS 9 being the fastest-adopted iOS version globally at the time, Vietnam lagged behind the worldwide trend in terms of uptake speed and penetration.\n\nThus, the direction of the difference is clear: **Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate in Q3 2015 was lower than the global average**.\n\n### Summary  \nVietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate (42%) was definitively lower than the global average (>50%) in Q3 2015, establishing the foundational comparison for the next step: calculating the exact percentage difference.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Calculate the Exact Percentage Difference Between Vietnam’s and Global iOS 9 Adoption Rates\n\nTo determine the precise numeric gap between Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate and the global average in Q3 2015, we use the confirmed values from the available data. Vietnam’s adoption rate is explicitly stated as **42%** [rag-1]. The global average is described as “over 50%” [rag-1], with Apple reporting that iOS 9 surpassed 50% adoption among iOS devices by September 19, 2015 — a date falling within Q3 2015 [rag-1]. \n\nSince the exact global percentage is not specified beyond “over 50%,” the most conservative and mathematically valid approach is to use the **minimum threshold** of 50% as the baseline for comparison. This ensures we calculate the *minimum possible difference* while remaining consistent with the data constraints. Any value higher than 50% would only widen the gap, making 8 percentage points the *minimum confirmed difference*.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Global Minimum Rate} - \\text{Vietnam's Rate} = 50\\% - 42\\% = 8\\%\n$$\n\nThis result is corroborated by direct code execution, which computed the difference using `global_rate_min = 50` and `vietnam_rate = 42`, yielding an output of `8` [code-1]. Furthermore, the knowledge base explicitly notes that “the difference in adoption rate was more than 8 percentage points,” aligning with this calculation [rag-1].\n\nThus, while the true global average may have been slightly higher than 50%, the smallest possible and fully supported difference based on verifiable data is **8 percentage points**.\n\n### Summary  \nThe exact minimum percentage difference between Vietnam’s iOS 9 adoption rate (42%) and the global average (≥50%) is **8 percentage points**, with Vietnam lagging behind. This value is both computationally verified and textually supported by the source materials.",
