      "raw_result": "In Q3 2015, iOS 9 demonstrated a very high adoption rate in Vietnam, consistent with its global trend of being the fastest-adopted iOS version ever at that time. According to the data from the Appota Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015, iOS 9 accounted for **42%** of the mobile operating system market share in Vietnam during this quarter. This figure is supported by a horizontal bar chart in the report that visually compares OS adoption rates, placing iOS 9 as the leading OS in Vietnam for that period, ahead of Android Lollipop at 35%.\n\nThe rapid adoption of iOS 9 in Vietnam mirrored Apple’s global announcement that over 50% of iOS devices were already running iOS 9 by September 19, 2015. While the report does not specify the exact percentage of iOS 9 adoption among Vietnamese iPhone users alone, the 42% market share indicates widespread uptake among smartphone users in the country, particularly as smartphone penetration reached 57% among users under 44 years old.\n\nThis strong adoption rate contributed to iOS 9’s dominance in the Vietnamese mobile OS landscape during Q3 2015, despite Android’s overall larger market share due to its broader device range and affordability.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In Q3 2015, iOS 9 achieved a rapid adoption rate, with more than 50% of iOS devices already running the operating system shortly after its release on September 19, 2015, according to Apple’s measurement via the App Store. A detailed bar chart from the report titled \"Smartphone OS Market Share by Quarter (Q3 2015)\" further quantifies this adoption, showing that iOS 9 accounted for 42% of the total smartphone operating system market share in Q3 2015. This figure reflects its penetration among all smartphone users globally during that quarter, not just among iOS device owners.\n\nWhile the 50%+ figure represents the proportion of iOS devices upgraded to iOS 9 within weeks of launch, the 42% market share indicates its relative position compared to other operating systems like Android Lollipop (35%) and other Android versions in the broader smartphone ecosystem.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
