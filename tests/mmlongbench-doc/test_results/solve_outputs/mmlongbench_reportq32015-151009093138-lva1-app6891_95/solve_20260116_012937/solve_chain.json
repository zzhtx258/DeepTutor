      "step_response": "## S1: Global Mobile App Count Comparison in 2014 — Apple App Store vs. Google Play Store\n\nIn 2014, the global mobile app ecosystem saw a pivotal shift in platform dominance by total available applications. According to verified data from the *App Store Growth Comparison Chart 2012–2015*, **Google Play Store surpassed Apple App Store** in the number of available mobile apps during that year [rag-1].\n\nSpecifically, the counts were as follows:\n\n- **Apple App Store**: `$1.25$` million apps  \n- **Google Play Store**: `$1.3$` million apps  \n\nThis means Google Play held a slight but measurable lead of `$0.05$` million (or 50,000) apps over Apple’s store in 2014. The crossover point marked a significant milestone in the mobile app market, reflecting Google’s broader device ecosystem and more permissive app submission policies at the time.\n\nThe data is consistent across both textual summaries and visual representations in the referenced chart, confirming that Google Play was the larger repository of mobile applications globally in 2014.\n\n---\n\nThis step establishes the factual baseline for answering the user’s question: Google Play Store had more apps in 2014, with exactly `$1.3$` million, compared to Apple’s `$1.25$` million.",
