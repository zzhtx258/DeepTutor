In 2014, the global mobile app ecosystem saw a pivotal shift in platform dominance by total available applications. According to verified data from the *App Store Growth Comparison Chart 2012–2015*, **Google Play Store surpassed Apple App Store** in the number of available mobile apps during that year [rag-1].

Specifically, the counts were as follows:

- **Apple App Store**: `$1.25$` million apps  
- **Google Play Store**: `$1.3$` million apps  

This means Google Play held a slight but measurable lead of `$0.05$` million (or 50,000) apps over Apple’s store in 2014. The crossover point marked a significant milestone in the mobile app market, reflecting Google’s broader device ecosystem and more permissive app submission policies at the time.
