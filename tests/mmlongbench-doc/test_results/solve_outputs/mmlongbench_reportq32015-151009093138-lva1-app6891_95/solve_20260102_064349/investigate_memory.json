While Android development is heavily associated with Java (especially in 2015), the context quantifies developer distribution by platform, not by programming language.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine the global developer market share percentage for Java.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
