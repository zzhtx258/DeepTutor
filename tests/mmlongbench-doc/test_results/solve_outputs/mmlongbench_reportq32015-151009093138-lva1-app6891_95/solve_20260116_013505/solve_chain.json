The summaries consistently state: *“No specific information available”* or *“Not answerable based on available documents.”* [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-4], [rag-5], [rag-6]\n\n- **Indirect Contextual Clues Only**: While the context confirms that:\n  - Incentive reward platforms were booming in Vietnam during Q3 2015.\n  - Appota’s Appdaily delivered **5–20k installs per day** via rewarded user actions.\n  - Ad networks like InMobi, AdMob, and Mobvista were active.\n  - CPI (Cost Per Install) was a known metric in the ecosystem.\n  \n  …none of these sources quantify the actual dollar amount spent per day to achieve those installs. There is no mention of budget ranges, campaign spend, or CPI values in USD for that period. [rag-3]\n\n- **Absence of Visual or Tabular Evidence**: No charts, tables, or figures were found that display cost-per-install or daily budget data for mobile incentive campaigns in Vietnam during Q3 2015. [rag-6]\n\n- **Tool Execution Result**: No code or search tool was executed in this step, as no relevant data was retrievable from the knowledge base to support calculation or derivation.\n\n### Logical Conclusion\n\nGiven that:\n- No direct cost figures are provided,\n- No indirect data (e.g., CPI × install volume) can be used to derive a daily cost range,\n- Multiple targeted searches across different phrasings yielded consistent “not found” results,\n\n…we conclude that **the question is not answerable with the current available materials**.\n\nThis does not imply the data does not exist elsewhere — only that it is absent from the provided corpus. Further research outside this dataset would be required to obtain the requested cost range.\n\n---\n\n**Final Determination**: Not answerable",
