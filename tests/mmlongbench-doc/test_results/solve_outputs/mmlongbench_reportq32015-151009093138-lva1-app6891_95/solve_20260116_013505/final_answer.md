## S1: Analysis of Available Data on Daily Installation Costs for Mobile Incentive Platforms in Vietnam (Q3 2015)

To determine whether the question — *“In Q3 2015, what is the approximate range of cost in 1 day (dollar) of a mobile incentive platform in Vietnam for installing?”* — is answerable, we conducted a systematic review of all available materials, including multiple RAG queries targeting cost ranges, pricing structures, charts, tables, and performance metrics related to mobile incentive platforms in Vietnam during Q3 2015.

### Key Findings from Available Materials

- **No Explicit Cost Data**: All six RAG queries explicitly seeking daily installation costs in USD for mobile incentive platforms in Vietnam during Q3 2015 returned negative results. The summaries consistently state: *“No specific information available”* or *“Not answerable based on available documents.”* [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-4], [rag-5], [rag-6]

- **Indirect Contextual Clues Only**: While the context confirms that:
  - Incentive reward platforms were booming in Vietnam during Q3 2015.
  - Appota’s Appdaily delivered **5–20k installs per day** via rewarded user actions.
  - Ad networks like InMobi, AdMob, and Mobvista were active.
  - CPI (Cost Per Install) was a known metric in the ecosystem.
  
  …none of these sources quantify the actual dollar amount spent per day to achieve those installs. There is no mention of budget ranges, campaign spend, or CPI values in USD for that period. [rag-3]

- **Absence of Visual or Tabular Evidence**: No charts, tables, or figures were found that display cost-per-install or daily budget data for mobile incentive campaigns in Vietnam during Q3 2015. [rag-6]

- **Tool Execution Result**: No code or search tool was executed in this step, as no relevant data was retrievable from the knowledge base to support calculation or derivation.

### Logical Conclusion

Given that:
- No direct cost figures are provided,
- No indirect data (e.g., CPI × install volume) can be used to derive a daily cost range,
- Multiple targeted searches across different phrasings yielded consistent “not found” results,

…we conclude that **the question is not answerable with the current available materials**.

This does not imply the data does not exist elsewhere — only that it is absent from the provided corpus. Further research outside this dataset would be required to obtain the requested cost range.

**Final Determination**: Not answerable

    The provided documents mention mobile incentive platforms in Vietnam during Q3 2015, particularly through Appota’s Appdaily launch strategy, which delivered 5–20k installs per day via rewarded user actions. However, no specific dollar cost range for installing a mobile incentive platform in one day is stated. The result references ad networks (InMobi, AdMob, Mobvista), Instagram ads, and performance charts but does not quantify installation costs in USD. Clues suggest the ecosystem was active and growing, but exact pricing data is absent.

    No relevant information found for this query. The question may be Not answerable based on available documents. While the context mentions incentive platforms delivering 5–20k installs per day in Vietnam and references CPI as a metric, no specific cost per install or daily budget range for Q3 2015 is provided. No charts, tables, or figures with this data are documented.
