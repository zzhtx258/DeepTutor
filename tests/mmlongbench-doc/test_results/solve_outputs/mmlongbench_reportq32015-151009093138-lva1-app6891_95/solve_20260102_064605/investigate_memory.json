However, it does offer partial insights into top-performing apps and related trends as of Q3 2015.\n\nFrom the available data, the following apps are explicitly mentioned as ranking highly on the Appota platform or in Vietnam’s mobile app ecosystem:\n\n- **Đột Kích** (Counter-Strike)  \n- **Liên Quân Mobile** (Arena of Valor)  \n- **Clash of Clans**  \n- **Angry Birds Space**  \n- **Farm Frenzy**  \n- **Temple Run 2**  \n- **Subway Surfers**  \n- **Candy Crush Saga**  \n- **Puzzle & Dragons**  \n- **Minecraft**  \n\nThese titles are identified in a bar chart titled *“Top 10 Most Downloaded Mobile Games in Vietnam - Q3 2015”* from the Appota report, which ranks the top 10 games by download volume. Additionally, other apps such as **Tieu Ngao Giang** and **Zing MP3-Dinh 2 Cao Am** appear prominently in screenshots of the Apple App Store’s “Top Free” category in Vietnam, suggesting strong popularity, though these are iOS apps.\n\nThe Appota platform is described as Vietnam’s number-one mobile content distribution platform, serving 18 million users, and it supports Android-based apps. The context also references a “boost top service” that helps advertisers rapidly elevate app rankings, indicating that app positions on Appota’s charts could be influenced by promotional services.\n\nWhile the top 10 games are documented, no official or complete list of the top 20 Android apps on Appota is provided in the context. Furthermore, the data does not distinguish between Android and iOS rankings in a consolidated list, nor does it extend beyond the top 10 downloaded games.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the provided information, only the top 10 most downloaded mobile games can be confirmed, and a full top 20 Android app ranking list for Appota in Vietnam is not available.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",

No official list extending to rank 15 or beyond is available in the context.",

However, it does include a detailed bar chart titled **“Top 10 Most Downloaded Mobile Games in Vietnam - Q3 2015”** on the Appota platform, which ranks the top 10 most downloaded mobile games during that period.

Additionally, the context references other app rankings in the Apple App Store (e.g., “Tieu Ngao Giang” and “Zing MP3-Dinh 2 Cao Am”) as top free apps, but these are iOS apps and not from the Appota platform.\n\nThere is no mention of a ranked list extending beyond the top 10 games or including non-game Android apps on Appota. Therefore, the top 15 Android apps on Appota in Vietnam cannot be determined from the provided information.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
