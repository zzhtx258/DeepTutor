## Detailed Answer

## S1: Availability Assessment of the 15th-Ranked Android App on Appota Platform in Vietnam

To determine whether the 15th-ranked Android app on the Appota platform in Vietnam is identifiable, we must evaluate the completeness and scope of the available data. According to the provided knowledge base, only the top 10 most downloaded mobile games on the Appota platform in Vietnam as of Q3 2015 are documented [rag-1][rag-2]. These include: *Đột Kích*, *Liên Quân Mobile*, *Clash of Clans*, *Angry Birds Space*, *Farm Frenzy*, *Temple Run 2*, *Subway Surfers*, *Candy Crush Saga*, *Puzzle & Dragons*, and *Minecraft* [rag-1]. 

Crucially, no official ranking list extending beyond the top 10 is present in the dataset. Neither non-game applications nor any apps ranked 11th through 20th are referenced in any of the provided sources [rag-2]. The explicit statement in both [rag-1] and [rag-2] confirms that “the provided data does not include a complete top 20 ranking” and “no information on rankings beyond position 10” exists. Furthermore, no tool execution or external search yielded supplementary data to fill this gap.

Since the 15th-ranked app lies outside the scope of the only available ranked subset (top 10), and no authoritative source, dataset, or statistical record is provided to infer or extrapolate positions 11–15, the requested information cannot be determined from the available materials.

### Summary
The 15th-ranked Android app on the Appota platform in Vietnam is not ascertainable from the current knowledge base, as only the top 10 mobile games are documented, with no data available for ranks 11 and beyond.
