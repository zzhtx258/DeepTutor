## S1: Evaluation of iOS 9 Percentage in Global iOS Breakdown

In evaluating the availability of data regarding the percentage of iOS 9 in the global iOS breakdown pie chart, it is important to note that there is currently insufficient information to provide a definitive answer. Multiple queries regarding the percentage of iOS 9 have yielded consistent results indicating a lack of specific details about the pie chart in question.

According to the available materials, including knowledge base citations, there is no data that specifies the percentage of iOS 9 within the global iOS breakdown. This absence of information suggests that either the data has not been collected or published, or that it is not readily accessible in the current context.

In summary, without concrete data or a visual representation of the pie chart, we cannot ascertain the percentage of iOS 9 in the global iOS breakdown. Further research or access to specific analytics would be required to obtain this information.
