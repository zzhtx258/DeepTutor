## S1: Analysis of Available Data for 15th Ranked Vietnam Android App on APPOTA Platform

To determine whether the 15th ranked Vietnam Android App on the APPOTA platform can be identified, we must evaluate the scope and completeness of the available data. According to the retrieved materials, all existing reports and visualizations produced by APPOTA — specifically the *Vietnam Mobile Apps Report Q3 2015* — only provide rankings for the **top ten** Vietnam Android applications [rag-1]. No document, table, or chart extends beyond this top-10 threshold to include positions such as 11th through 15th.

Furthermore, no additional tool execution results or supplementary datasets were returned that could fill this gap. The absence of any mention of a 15th-ranked app — even in summary form — confirms that the required information is not present in the current corpus.

Therefore, based strictly on the evidence provided:

> The 15th ranked Vietnam Android App on the APPOTA platform **cannot be identified** from available data, as only the top ten apps are listed in the provided reports [rag-1].

This conclusion is not due to insufficient search effort but rather a structural limitation of the source material itself — it simply does not contain the requested ranking position.

### Summary
The available documentation from APPOTA is limited to the top ten Vietnam Android apps for Q3 2015, making it impossible to identify the 15th-ranked app. No further derivation or calculation is possible without external or extended datasets.
