While the report focuses on games, it does not explicitly list top non-game iOS apps. However, another image from the same report shows a screenshot of the Apple App Store’s “Top Free” charts in Vietnam, featuring apps such as **Tieu Ngao Giang** and **Zing MP3-Dinh 2 Cao Am**, indicating their prominence in the Vietnamese iOS app market, though these are not ranked within the top 10 downloads by Appota’s game-specific data.\n\nThe Appota platform primarily served as a content distribution channel for mobile games and apps in Vietnam, and its data reflects strong local preferences for action, strategy, and casual gaming titles during Q3 2015.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] reportq32015-151009093138-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",

These are all games that were popular on Android via Appota, but the available data does not indicate that any of them were in the top 10 iOS apps in Vietnam during the same period, as iOS rankings featured different apps like Tiêu Ngao Giang and Zing MP3-Dinh 2 Cao Am. Therefore, all 10 Appota top games are likely candidates for being in the top 10 Android apps but not top 10 iOS apps.",
