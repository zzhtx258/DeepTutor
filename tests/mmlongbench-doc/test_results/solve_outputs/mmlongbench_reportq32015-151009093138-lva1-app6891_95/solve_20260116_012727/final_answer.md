## S1: Analysis of iOS 9’s Share in Global iOS Version Breakdown

To determine the percentage of iOS 9 in the global iOS version breakdown, we refer directly to the pie chart data derived from Apple App Store analytics as of September 19, 2015. This dataset provides a clear and quantified distribution of iOS versions across all active devices globally at that time.

According to the available materials, the pie chart explicitly states:

- **iOS 9**: `$51\%$`  
- **iOS 8**: `$41\%$`  
- **Earlier iOS Versions** (combined): `$8\%$`

This indicates that iOS 9 was the dominant version shortly after its release, capturing more than half of the global iOS user base within weeks of launch [rag-1].

The rapid adoption rate reflects strong user uptake, likely driven by new features, security updates, and Apple’s effective over-the-air update mechanisms. The fact that iOS 9 surpassed iOS 8 — which had been the previous leading version — by a significant margin (`$51\%$` vs. `$41\%$`) underscores the momentum behind the new OS release.

No additional calculations or derivations are required, as the value is directly provided in the source material.

### Summary
iOS 9 accounted for exactly `$51\%$` of the global iOS version breakdown as of September 19, 2015, according to Apple App Store analytics data [rag-1]. This figure represents the largest single share among all iOS versions at that time.
