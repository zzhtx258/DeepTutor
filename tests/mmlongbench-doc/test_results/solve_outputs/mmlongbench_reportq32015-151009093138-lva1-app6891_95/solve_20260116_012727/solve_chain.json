      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of iOS 9’s Share in Global iOS Version Breakdown\n\nTo determine the percentage of iOS 9 in the global iOS version breakdown, we refer directly to the pie chart data derived from Apple App Store analytics as of September 19, 2015. This dataset provides a clear and quantified distribution of iOS versions across all active devices globally at that time.\n\nAccording to the available materials, the pie chart explicitly states:\n\n- **iOS 9**: `$51\\%$`  \n- **iOS 8**: `$41\\%$`  \n- **Earlier iOS Versions** (combined): `$8\\%$`\n\nThis indicates that iOS 9 was the dominant version shortly after its release, capturing more than half of the global iOS user base within weeks of launch [rag-1].\n\nThe rapid adoption rate reflects strong user uptake, likely driven by new features, security updates, and Apple’s effective over-the-air update mechanisms. The fact that iOS 9 surpassed iOS 8 — which had been the previous leading version — by a significant margin (`$51\\%$` vs. `$41\\%$`) underscores the momentum behind the new OS release.\n\nNo additional calculations or derivations are required, as the value is directly provided in the source material.\n\n### Summary\niOS 9 accounted for exactly `$51\\%$` of the global iOS version breakdown as of September 19, 2015, according to Apple App Store analytics data [rag-1]. This figure represents the largest single share among all iOS versions at that time.",
