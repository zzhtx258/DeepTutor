Specifically, it involves integrating knowledge into white-box models through a technique known as directive fine-tuning. This approach substitutes the retriever module in RAG to generate relevant documents according to a specific query. This method addresses difficulties encountered during the fine-tuning process, enhancing the overall performance of the model. \n\nDirective fine-tuning not only aims to improve retrieval outcomes but also facilitates the generation of information in a manner that is contextually relevant and aligned with the query requirements.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey",
