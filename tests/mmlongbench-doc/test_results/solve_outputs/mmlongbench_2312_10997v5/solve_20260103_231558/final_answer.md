## S1: Method Integrating Knowledge into White-Box Models via Directive Fine-Tuning

The method that integrates knowledge into white-box models through directive fine-tuning is known as **Prompt-Knowledge Generation (PKG)**. This approach is part of a broader category of techniques, including **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which also employs directive fine-tuning to enhance model performance.

### Explanation of PKG and RAG

1. **Prompt-Knowledge Generation (PKG)**:
   - PKG directly generates relevant documents in response to specific queries by substituting the traditional retriever module. This method leverages directive fine-tuning to ensure that the generated information is contextually relevant and tailored to the user's needs. By embedding knowledge directly into the model, PKG enhances the overall effectiveness of the white-box model in generating accurate and pertinent outputs.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - RAG also integrates knowledge into white-box models via directive fine-tuning. It enhances model performance by replacing the retriever module, allowing for the generation of relevant documents based on the input queries. The directive fine-tuning process in RAG addresses challenges in the fine-tuning process, ensuring that the model's outputs are not only relevant but also improve the retrieval outcomes.

Both methods, PKG and RAG, utilize directive fine-tuning as a critical component to improve the integration of knowledge into the models, ultimately leading to better performance in generating contextually appropriate responses.

In summary, the methods that integrate knowledge into white-box models via directive fine-tuning are **Prompt-Knowledge Generation (PKG)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. These approaches enhance model performance by effectively embedding knowledge and ensuring the relevance of generated information to specific queries.

## S2: Integration of Findings on Parametric Knowledge Guidance (PKG)

The method that integrates knowledge into white-box models via directive fine-tuning is known as **Parametric Knowledge Guidance (PKG)**. This innovative approach substitutes the traditional retriever module with a mechanism that directly generates relevant documents based on specific queries. By doing so, PKG enhances the model's ability to leverage context-specific knowledge effectively, which has significant implications for model performance.

### Implications for Model Performance

1. **Improved Model Accuracy**: PKG provides direct access to contextually relevant information, which allows the model to generate more accurate responses. This enhancement stems from the model's ability to align its outputs closely with the specific knowledge required for a given task, leading to a higher quality of generated content.

2. **Streamlined Retrieval Process**: By eliminating the reliance on external sources for document retrieval, PKG simplifies the overall retrieval process. This reduction in dependency not only enhances efficiency but also minimizes potential delays associated with fetching data from external databases.

3. **Robustness and Informed Decision-Making**: The integration of knowledge through PKG contributes to the robustness of the model. With a better alignment of outputs to desired knowledge, the model can make more informed decisions. This capability is particularly crucial in applications where precision and reliability are paramount.

4. **Bias Reduction**: Traditional models often exhibit biases due to their reliance on external data sources that may not be representative. PKG addresses this issue by embedding knowledge directly into the model, potentially reducing biases and leading to fairer outcomes in decision-making processes.

In summary, the implementation of Parametric Knowledge Guidance (PKG) through directive fine-tuning not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of white-box models but also promotes robustness and reduces biases. This makes PKG a significant advancement in the field of model performance, particularly in applications that require high levels of specificity and reliability.
