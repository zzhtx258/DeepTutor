While Figure 1 (\"Technology tree of RAG research\") illustrates a hierarchical tree structure with three main branches—Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Inference—each containing varying numbers of sub-techniques, the documents do not assign a formal term to the branch with the fewest nodes or leaves.\n\nThe visual analysis of Figure 1 indicates that the Pre-training branch has only one sub-node (“Retrieval-augmented Pre-training”), while Fine-tuning has two (“Retrieval-augmented Fine-tuning,” “Adapter-based RAG”) and Inference has seven (e.g., Retrieval, Prompt Engineering, Re-ranking, etc.). Thus, Pre-training is the branch with the least leaves. However, no specific terminology such as “minimal branch,” “sparse branch,” or similar is used in the text to describe this characteristic.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there is no established terminology for the tree diagram branch with the least leaves.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
