      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Table II for Dataset-to-Method Count Mapping\n\nTo determine which datasets have exactly three methods according to Table II, we must first verify whether the table contains the necessary dataset-to-method count mapping. Based on a comprehensive review of all available materials — including six distinct RAG-hybrid queries and a direct tool-based summary — **no explicit numerical data or tabular mapping exists that associates each dataset with a specific count of evaluation methods**.\n\nWhile Table II is consistently described as a structured inventory cataloging downstream tasks, subtasks, datasets, and methods used to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3][rag-4][rag-5][rag-6], none of the sources provide the actual dataset-level method counts required to answer the question. For example:\n\n- Datasets such as NQ, HotpotQA, ELI5, StrategyQA, and MuSiQue are mentioned as part of the QA category [rag-2], but no method counts are attached to them.\n- The table is noted to categorize datasets under QA (17 datasets), Dialog, Information Extraction, Reasoning, Math, and Others [rag-6], yet this classification does not include per-dataset method quantification.\n- Multiple queries explicitly sought “complete data/numbers” or “mapping of datasets to number of methods,” and all returned negative results, confirming the absence of such mappings in the provided context [rag-1][rag-3][rag-4][rag-5].\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the evidence available, **it is not possible to identify any datasets that have exactly three methods**, because the foundational data — the method count per dataset — is not present in Table II or any referenced material.\n\n### Summary\nThe current knowledge base lacks the granular dataset-to-method count mapping required to fulfill the query. Without access to the actual numerical entries of Table II, determining which datasets have exactly three methods remains unanswerable at this stage. Further retrieval of the original Table II data would be necessary to proceed.",
