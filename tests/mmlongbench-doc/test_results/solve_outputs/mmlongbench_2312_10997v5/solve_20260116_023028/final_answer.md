## S1: Analysis of Table II for Dataset-to-Method Count Mapping

To determine which datasets have exactly three methods according to Table II, we must first verify whether the table contains the necessary dataset-to-method count mapping. Based on a comprehensive review of all available materials — including six distinct RAG-hybrid queries and a direct tool-based summary — **no explicit numerical data or tabular mapping exists that associates each dataset with a specific count of evaluation methods**.

While Table II is consistently described as a structured inventory cataloging downstream tasks, subtasks, datasets, and methods used to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3][rag-4][rag-5][rag-6], none of the sources provide the actual dataset-level method counts required to answer the question. For example:

- Datasets such as NQ, HotpotQA, ELI5, StrategyQA, and MuSiQue are mentioned as part of the QA category [rag-2], but no method counts are attached to them.
- The table is noted to categorize datasets under QA (17 datasets), Dialog, Information Extraction, Reasoning, Math, and Others [rag-6], yet this classification does not include per-dataset method quantification.
- Multiple queries explicitly sought “complete data/numbers” or “mapping of datasets to number of methods,” and all returned negative results, confirming the absence of such mappings in the provided context [rag-1][rag-3][rag-4][rag-5].

Therefore, based strictly on the evidence available, **it is not possible to identify any datasets that have exactly three methods**, because the foundational data — the method count per dataset — is not present in Table II or any referenced material.

### Summary
The current knowledge base lacks the granular dataset-to-method count mapping required to fulfill the query. Without access to the actual numerical entries of Table II, determining which datasets have exactly three methods remains unanswerable at this stage. Further retrieval of the original Table II data would be necessary to proceed.

    The provided context mentions Table II, which lists downstream tasks and datasets for RAG systems, including QA (17 datasets), Dialog, Information Extraction, Reasoning, and Others. Specific datasets like NQ, HotpotQA, ELI5, NoMIRACL, GraphQA, ZsRE, CSQA, StrategyQA, SQuAD, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue are referenced. However, the exact number of methods associated with each dataset is not specified in the available information. Therefore, it is not possible to identify which datasets have exactly three methods based on this result.

    The provided result does not contain the complete data or numerical entries from Table II. It only describes the table’s purpose and mentions some datasets (e.g., StrategyQA, GraphQA, CodeSearchNet) associated with RAG evaluation methods, but no dataset-to-method counts or mappings are given. Therefore, it is not possible to identify which datasets have exactly three methods based on this information.

    No relevant information found for this query. The question may be Not answerable based on available documents. While Table II is mentioned as cataloging datasets and methods for RAG evaluation, the actual data mapping datasets to the exact number of methods (including which datasets have exactly three methods) is not provided in the result. Some datasets are named (e.g., NQ, HotpotQA), but no method counts per dataset are listed.

    The provided result confirms the existence of Table II, which catalogs downstream tasks, datasets, and associated RAG methods. However, it does not include the actual dataset-method mappings or numerical data needed to identify which datasets have exactly three methods. The document lists datasets under categories like QA, Dialog, Information Extraction, Reasoning, Math, and Others, but no explicit count of methods per dataset is given. Therefore, the specific answer to the question cannot be determined from this result.
