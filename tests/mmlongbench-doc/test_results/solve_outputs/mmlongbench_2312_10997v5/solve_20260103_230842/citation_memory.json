However, it discusses retrieval granularity in the context of various retrieval methods, including mentioning a concept introduced by DenseX which uses propositions as retrieval units. \n\nRetrieval granularity is defined as the level of detail that retrieval units can have, ranging from fine to coarse (e.g., Token, Phrase, Sentence, Proposition, Chunks, Document). The emphasis is that choosing the appropriate retrieval granularity is crucial for enhancing the performance of retrieval systems. Coarse-grained units can provide relevant information but may also introduce redundancy, whereas fine-grained units increase the retrieval burden without ensuring semantic integrity.\n\nFor exact citations or references, please provide further details or queries on specific aspects or methods related to retrieval granularity.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
