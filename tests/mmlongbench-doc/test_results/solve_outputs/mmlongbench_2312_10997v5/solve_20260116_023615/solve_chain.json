      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of the Method for Integrating Knowledge via Directive Fine-Tuning in White-Box Models\n\nThe method that integrates knowledge into white-box models through directive fine-tuning is **PKG (Parametric Knowledge Guiding)** [rag-1]. This approach operates by substituting the retriever module within a model architecture to directly generate contextually relevant documents based on input queries. By doing so, PKG enables the structured or external knowledge to be injected into the model in a targeted and instruction-aligned manner.\n\nDirective fine-tuning, as implemented in PKG, allows for precise adaptation of specific model components — particularly the retriever — to conform with task-specific directives. This modularity is especially advantageous in white-box models, where internal structures are transparent and accessible, facilitating controlled and interpretable knowledge integration.\n\nIn essence, PKG transforms the retrieval process from a black-box operation into a parametric, trainable component that can be fine-tuned according to explicit instructions, thereby enhancing both performance and interpretability in knowledge-intensive tasks.\n\nThis method is distinct from general fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches because it explicitly targets the retriever module for parametric adaptation under directive guidance, making it uniquely suited for white-box architectures where component-level control is required [rag-1].\n\n### Summary\nPKG (Parametric Knowledge Guiding) is the identified method that enables knowledge integration into white-box models via directive fine-tuning, primarily through substitution and adaptation of the retriever module to align with task-specific instructions.",
