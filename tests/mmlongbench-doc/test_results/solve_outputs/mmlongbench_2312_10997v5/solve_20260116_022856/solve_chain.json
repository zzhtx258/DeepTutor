      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of the Paper Combining Phrase-Level Retrieval and Tuning Augmentation\n\nBased on the available materials, the paper that proposes a method with **retrieval granularity at the phrase level** and an **augmentation stage involving tuning** is **CoG [29]**.\n\n### Concept Clarification\n- **Phrase-level retrieval granularity** refers to retrieving short, meaningful word groups (phrases) rather than full sentences or documents. This allows for finer-grained contextual alignment during retrieval-augmented generation.\n- **Augmentation through tuning** means that retrieved information is integrated into the model during fine-tuning (as opposed to pre-training or inference-time augmentation), enabling the model to learn how to effectively utilize external knowledge during training.\n\n### Logical Derivation\nFrom the provided knowledge base:\n- The first RAG query (`[rag-1]`) initially suggests *no* paper combines both characteristics — but this appears to be an incomplete interpretation.\n- The second RAG query (`[rag-2]`) explicitly confirms that **CoG [29]** is the *only* documented method that satisfies both conditions:\n  - It uses **Wikipedia** as its retrieval source.\n  - It operates at the **phrase level**, defined as “short meaningful word groups”.\n  - It integrates retrieved phrases during **model fine-tuning**, thereby performing augmentation via tuning.\n\nThis conclusion is further supported by the tool execution result, which simply returns “CoG [29]”, reinforcing its centrality in answering the query.\n\n### Summary\nThe paper **CoG [29]** is uniquely identified in the available materials as the method that combines phrase-level retrieval granularity with augmentation through tuning. No other methods in the dataset satisfy both criteria simultaneously.",
