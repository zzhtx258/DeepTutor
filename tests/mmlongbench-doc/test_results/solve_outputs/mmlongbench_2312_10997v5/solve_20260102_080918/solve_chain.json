      "step_response": "## S1: Identify the Method with Phrase-Level Retrieval Granularity\n\nThe method that introduces phrase-level retrieval granularity is identified as **CoG** (Contextualized Generation) [rag-1]. This approach explicitly operates at the phrase level, meaning that during the retrieval phase, it extracts and utilizes contiguous semantic units—phrases—from a knowledge source (in this case, Wikipedia) to augment the generation process [rag-1]. Unlike methods that retrieve at the sentence or document level, CoG’s granularity is fine-tuned to capture localized, contextually rich fragments that are more aligned with the semantic structure of natural language queries.\n\nThe paper associated with CoG cites its use of pre-training as an augmentation strategy, which enhances the model’s ability to generate coherent responses conditioned on these phrase-level retrieved units [rag-1]. While other methods, such as DenseX, operate at even finer granularities—such as propositions, defined as atomic, self-contained factual expressions in natural language [rag-1]—CoG remains the first method explicitly designed for phrase-level retrieval within the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework.\n\nThus, the method with phrase-level retrieval granularity is CoG [29], and the paper proposing this method is the one in which CoG is introduced and evaluated, as referenced in [rag-1].\n\n### Summary\nCoG [29] is the method that proposes phrase-level retrieval granularity, as confirmed by the knowledge base [rag-1]. This distinguishes it from both coarser (sentence/document) and finer (proposition-level) retrieval approaches.",

According to the available materials, this citation is associated with the author T. Lan and a paper titled *“Copy is all you need”* [rag-2]. However, despite this partial alignment, **the full paper title is not explicitly confirmed** within the provided knowledge chain.\n\nThe evidence is inconsistent: while one source suggests that [29] corresponds to *“Copy is all you need”* by Lan, T., et al., it explicitly notes that this association is *not verified* [rag-2]. Furthermore, another source confirms only that the author T. Lan is linked to CoG [29], but again, no full title is stated or corroborated [rag-3]. Crucially, none of the provided documents—whether through direct quotation, table metadata, or reference list expansion—contain the complete, officially published title of the paper introducing CoG.\n\nIn academic contexts, citation [29] must map unambiguously to a unique, verifiable publication. Here, the knowledge base provides only a plausible candidate (*“Copy is all you need”*) without authoritative confirmation. The absence of a DOI, conference/journal name, or direct excerpt from the paper’s abstract or title page means that the association remains speculative rather than established.\n\nTherefore, while CoG [29] is definitively the method with phrase-level retrieval granularity [rag-1], **the full title of the associated paper cannot be confirmed from the available materials**.\n\n### Summary\nAlthough CoG [29] is linked to author T. Lan and a candidate title *“Copy is all you need”*, the knowledge base does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the full, official title of the paper proposing the CoG method.",

The most recent and direct evidence from the tool execution result [rag-4] provides a complete bibliographic citation for this work:  \n\n> *T. Lan, D. Cai, Y. Wang, H. Huang, and X.-L. Mao, “Copy is all you need,” in The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.* [rag-4]\n\nThis citation explicitly links the title *“Copy is all you need”* to the CoG method, confirms its presentation at ICLR 2022, and lists all authors, thereby resolving prior ambiguities from earlier sources that only hinted at the title without verification [rag-2][rag-3]. The retrieval granularity of “Phrase” is explicitly listed for CoG [29] in Table I of the context, directly tying the method to this paper [rag-4].\n\nWhile earlier steps noted uncertainty due to lack of corroboration, the current evidence from [rag-4] is authoritative: it originates from a structured query of the context’s reference table and returns the full, formatted citation as it appears in the source material. There is no conflicting citation in the available materials, and no alternative title is proposed for CoG [29]. Therefore, the association is now empirically grounded in the provided context.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this conclusion is contingent on the integrity of the provided context. In a broader academic setting, one would ideally verify this title against the official ICLR 2022 proceedings or a DOI-linked publication (e.g., via OpenReview or arXiv). Yet, within the constraints of the available materials, no such discrepancy exists, and the citation from [rag-4] is the most complete and directly supported version available.\n\n### Summary\nThe full title of the paper proposing the CoG method with phrase-level retrieval granularity is *“Copy is all you need”* by Lan et al., presented at ICLR 2022 [rag-4]. This conclusion is now fully supported by direct evidence from the context, resolving prior uncertainties.",
