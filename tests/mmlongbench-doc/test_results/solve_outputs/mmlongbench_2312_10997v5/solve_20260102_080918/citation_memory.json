CoG [29] utilizes Wikipedia as its retrieval source and operates on text data with phrase-level granularity, leveraging pre-training as its augmentation strategy.\n\nThus, CoG [29] is the method in the provided context that proposes retrieval at the phrase-level granularity.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
