While propositions represent a fine-grained unit beyond phrases, the table summarizing RAG methods (Table I) in the same document identifies CoG [29] as a method that explicitly employs **phrase-level** retrieval granularity. CoG [29] utilizes Wikipedia as its retrieval source and operates on text data with phrase-level granularity, leveraging pre-training as its augmentation strategy.\n\nThus, CoG [29] is the method in the provided context that proposes retrieval at the phrase-level granularity.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
