      "step_response": "## S1: Identifying the Method for Knowledge Integration via Directive Fine-Tuning\n\nThe method that integrates knowledge into white-box models via directive fine-tuning is, as explicitly stated in the provided knowledge snippet, **directive fine-tuning** itself [rag-1]. This approach represents a paradigm shift from conventional retrieval-augmented architectures, which rely on external retrievers and static knowledge bases during inference [rag-1]. Instead, directive fine-tuning eliminates the need for a separate retrieval module by directly embedding the knowledge retrieval and generation capability into the model’s internal parameters through targeted fine-tuning [rag-1].\n\nIn traditional retrieval-augmented systems, a two-stage pipeline is employed: first, a retriever fetches relevant documents from an external corpus based on the input query; second, a generator consumes these documents to produce a response. This introduces latency, dependency on external systems, and potential misalignment between retrieval and generation components [rag-1]. Directive fine-tuning overcomes these limitations by training the white-box model—typically a large language model—to *generate* the necessary contextual documents on-demand, conditioned solely on the input query. The model learns to simulate the behavior of a retriever internally, producing contextually relevant text that aligns with external knowledge, without ever accessing an external database at inference time [rag-1].\n\nThis internalization of knowledge retrieval enables the model to maintain high accuracy and adaptability in knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering or factual reasoning, while preserving the efficiency and autonomy of a purely generative architecture. The term “directive” reflects the instruction-driven nature of the fine-tuning process, where the model is trained to follow directives like “generate a passage explaining X” or “retrieve facts about Y,” effectively turning the model into its own knowledge source [rag-1].\n\nThus, directive fine-tuning is not merely a technique for improving model performance—it is the specific method designed to integrate external knowledge into white-box models by replacing the external retriever with an internally learned, query-conditioned knowledge generation mechanism [rag-1].\n\nDirective fine-tuning is the method that integrates knowledge into white-box models via directive fine-tuning, as it replaces the traditional retriever module to generate relevant documents on-demand according to a given query, aligning internal parameters with external knowledge without requiring separate retrieval components during inference.",
