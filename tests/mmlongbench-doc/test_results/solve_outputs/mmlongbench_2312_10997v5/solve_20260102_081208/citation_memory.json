In this approach, the traditional retriever module is directly substituted to generate relevant documents according to a given query. This method addresses challenges encountered during conventional fine-tuning processes, particularly when integrating external knowledge into models with transparent, interpretable architectures. By enabling the model to generate contextually relevant documents on-demand, directive fine-tuning enhances performance without requiring separate retrieval components or external knowledge bases during inference. This technique facilitates a more seamless and efficient alignment between the model’s internal parameters and the external knowledge it needs to access, improving accuracy and adaptability in knowledge-intensive tasks.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
