Each panel uses rectangular boxes and directional arrows to represent components and their flow, but no distinct icons (such as logos, pictograms, or symbolic graphics beyond standard flowchart elements) are described in the visual analysis.\n\nThe components depicted are standard flowchart elements:\n- Rectangular boxes for stages (e.g., “Indexing,” “Retrieval,” “Generation”),\n- Arrows indicating directional flow,\n- Sub-elements labeled textually (e.g., “Query Rewriting,” “Re-ranking,” “Memory,” “Routing”),\n- Dashed borders to suggest replaceability in Modular RAG.\n\nNo unique or distinct icons (e.g., puzzle pieces, gears, logos, or specialized symbols) are mentioned as being present in Figure 3. Such icons are noted in Figure 6 (e.g., icons for LangChain, Weaviate, Cohere Coral), but not in Figure 3.\n\nThus, the count of distinct icons in Figure 3 is zero.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
