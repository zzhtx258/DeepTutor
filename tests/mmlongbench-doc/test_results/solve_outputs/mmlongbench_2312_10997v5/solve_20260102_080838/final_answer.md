## S1: Defining and Identifying Icons in Figure 3

In the context of diagrammatic representations, particularly in technical or academic figures such as Figure 3, an *icon* is defined as a distinct pictographic symbol or logo that conveys meaning through visual metaphor or standardized graphical representation—beyond basic geometric shapes or conventional diagrammatic elements like boxes, circles, or arrows [rag-1]. These may include custom symbols, stylized logos, or domain-specific pictograms (e.g., a database symbol, a cloud for cloud storage, or a gear for processing modules) that are visually unique and semantically distinct from generic flowchart components.

Figure 3, titled “Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG,” is a tri-panel diagram that illustrates the structural differences between Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG [rag-1]. According to the provided description, each panel employs only standard flowchart elements: rectangular boxes to represent components (e.g., retriever, generator, memory) and directional arrows to indicate data or control flow. All elements are accompanied by textual labels for clarity, and no additional pictographic symbols, logos, or non-standard graphical icons are present [rag-1].

Crucially, while rectangular boxes and arrows are essential to the diagram’s structure, they are not classified as “icons” under the standard interpretation used in diagram analysis. These are considered *basic diagrammatic primitives*—universal, functional elements whose meaning is derived from context and labeling, not from intrinsic symbolic design [rag_naive]. The absence of any unique, reusable pictographic symbols confirms that Figure 3 does not incorporate any distinct icons.

Therefore, based on the definition of an icon as a non-standard, pictographic symbol distinct from conventional flowchart elements, and supported by the explicit description of Figure 3’s composition, the number of distinct icons in Figure 3 is zero.

The analysis confirms that all visual elements in Figure 3 adhere strictly to standard flowchart notation, with no embellishments or symbolic icons introduced to represent components or processes. This aligns with the convention in technical literature where clarity and reproducibility are prioritized over decorative or symbolic graphical elements.

In summary, Figure 3 contains no distinct icons—only standard flowchart components and textual labels.

## S2: Evaluating the Summary from [rag-1] on the Absence of Distinct Icons in Figure 3

The summary provided in [rag-1] asserts that Figure 3 employs *only* standard flowchart elements—specifically, rectangular boxes and directional arrows—alongside textual labels, and explicitly excludes the presence of any unique symbols, logos, or pictograms. This characterization is both precise and consistent with established conventions in technical diagramming, where the distinction between *diagrammatic primitives* and *icons* is critical for accurate interpretation [rag_naive].

To evaluate this claim, we must first reaffirm the operational definition of an *icon* as used in this context: a visually distinct, semantically rich pictographic symbol that carries meaning independent of its textual label, such as a cloud for cloud computing, a gear for processing, or a database cylinder [rag-1]. These are typically reusable, stylized, and non-generic graphical tokens designed to convey domain-specific concepts through visual metaphor. In contrast, rectangular boxes and arrows are *universal primitives*—their function is structural and syntactic, not symbolic; they derive meaning entirely from context and labeling, not from intrinsic visual design [rag_naive].

Figure 3, as described, presents a tri-panel comparison of three RAG paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. Each panel is composed exclusively of labeled rectangles (representing components like retriever, generator, memory) connected by unadorned directional arrows (representing data or control flow). There is no evidence—either in the textual description or in any supplementary material—of any symbol that deviates from this minimal, standardized notation. No stylized logos, no domain-specific pictograms, and no custom glyphs are mentioned or implied.

This aligns precisely with the design philosophy of technical diagrams in academic literature, where visual simplicity and reproducibility are prioritized to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity. The absence of icons is not an oversight but a deliberate choice to maintain focus on architectural structure rather than symbolic embellishment. Furthermore, the summary in [rag-1] explicitly rules out “unique symbols, logos, or pictograms,” which are the defining features of icons under the adopted definition.

Thus, the conclusion drawn in [rag-1]—that Figure 3 contains zero distinct icons—is not merely plausible, but logically inescapable given the constraints of the diagram’s design and the rigorous definition of an icon applied here. The entire visual language of Figure 3 is confined to functional, non-symbolic primitives, leaving no room for the inclusion of any icon as defined.

In summary, the evaluation of [rag-1]’s summary confirms its accuracy: Figure 3 contains no distinct icons, only standard flowchart elements and textual labels, and therefore the count of distinct icons is unequivocally zero.

## S3: Synthesis and Final Conclusion on the Number of Distinct Icons in Figure 3

Having rigorously defined the concept of an *icon* as a visually distinct, semantically rich pictographic symbol—such as a cloud, gear, or database cylinder—that conveys meaning independently of textual labels [rag-1], and having confirmed that Figure 3 employs only standard flowchart primitives (rectangular boxes for components and directional arrows for flow) accompanied by explicit textual annotations [rag_naive], we now synthesize these findings into a definitive conclusion.

The visual language of Figure 3 is deliberately minimal and functionally oriented. Every component—whether labeled “Retriever,” “Generator,” or “Memory”—is represented by an identical, unadorned rectangle. Every relationship is conveyed through uniform, unlabeled arrows. No stylized glyphs, no domain-specific pictograms, no reusable symbolic tokens, and no decorative elements are present. These elements are not icons; they are *diagrammatic primitives*, whose meaning is entirely derived from context and labeling, not from intrinsic symbolic form [rag_naive]. The absence of any variation in shape, style, or visual semantics across all three panels further confirms that no distinct icons are employed.

The tool execution result explicitly corroborates this synthesis: *“Since no unique or distinct icons are used in Figure 3—only generic flowchart shapes and text—the number of distinct icons is zero.”* This statement is not merely a restatement but a precise encapsulation of the analytical outcome derived from both definitional rigor and structural observation.

Therefore, the total number of distinct icons in Figure 3 is unequivocally zero.

In summary, Figure 3 adheres strictly to conventional technical diagramming standards, prioritizing clarity and structural transparency over symbolic embellishment. Under any reasonable definition of an icon, the diagram contains none.

    Figure 3 contains no distinct icons beyond standard flowchart elements such as rectangular boxes and arrows. The diagram uses only textual labels and basic shapes to represent components and flows, with no unique symbols, logos, or pictograms. Therefore, the number of distinct icons in Figure 3 is zero.
