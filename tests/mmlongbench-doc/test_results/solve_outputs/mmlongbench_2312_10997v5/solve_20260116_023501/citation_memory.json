      "raw_result": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit section titled **“AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG”**. However, the concept of **Augmentation** is discussed within the broader framework of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), particularly in relation to **Section V**, which analyzes the three augmentation processes involved in the RAG framework.\n\nAccording to the knowledge graph data:\n\n- **Section V** focuses on analyzing the three key augmentation processes:  \n  1. **Iterative Retrieval** — Alternates between retrieval and generation steps for richer context, iterating up to N times until a threshold is met.  \n  2. **Recursive Retrieval** — Refines search queries iteratively by decomposing complex problems into sub-problems, solving them through repeated retrieval and generation until a max depth or threshold is reached.  \n  3. **Adaptive Retrieval** — Enables the LLM to autonomously decide when and what content to retrieve, often using special tokens generated by the model to control the process.\n\nThese three processes are visually summarized in the **RAG_Augmentation_Processes_Flowchart (image)** and also referenced in **Fig. 5**, which compares these advanced strategies with basic single-retrieval RAG.\n\nAdditionally, **Augmentation** itself is described as a core component of the RAG framework that integrates retrieved information into the LLM’s generation process to enhance output quality.\n\nThus, while there is no subsection explicitly under a heading “AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG”, the relevant content is organized under **Section V**, which details the following augmentation processes:\n\n- Iterative Retrieval\n- Recursive Retrieval\n- Adaptive Retrieval\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Section V\n- [2] RAG_Augmentation_Processes_Flowchart (image)\n- [3] Fig. 5\n- [4] Augmentation\n- [5] Iterative Retrieval",
