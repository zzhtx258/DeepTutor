This section details three distinct augmentation strategies that enhance the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by dynamically integrating retrieval with generation processes.\n\nThe three subsections included under this conceptual umbrella are:\n\n1. **Iterative Retrieval**: This process alternates between retrieval and generation phases, repeating up to $N$ times to refine the output iteratively. It enables progressive improvement of responses through successive rounds of information gathering and synthesis [rag-1].\n\n2. **Recursive Retrieval**: This method decomposes complex problems into smaller sub-problems, applying iterative refinement at each level. It supports hierarchical reasoning and modular problem-solving within the RAG architecture [rag-1].\n\n3. **Adaptive Retrieval**: In this approach, the Large Language Model (LLM) autonomously determines when and what information to retrieve using special tokens. This introduces a degree of self-regulation and context-awareness into the retrieval mechanism, allowing for more flexible and intelligent augmentation [rag-1].\n\nThese three augmentation processes are also visually represented in the *RAG_Augmentation_Processes_Flowchart* and referenced in *Fig. 5*, providing a schematic overview of how each strategy integrates into the broader RAG pipeline [rag-1].\n\nIn summary, while the exact section title “AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG” does not appear in the document, its functional equivalent is fully articulated in Section V through these three well-defined subsections: Iterative Retrieval, Recursive Retrieval, and Adaptive Retrieval.",
