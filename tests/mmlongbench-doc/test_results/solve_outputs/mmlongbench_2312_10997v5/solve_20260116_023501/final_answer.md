## S1: Identification of Subsections Under "AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG"

Although the document does not contain an explicitly titled section named **“AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG”**, the content relevant to this concept is comprehensively covered under **Section V**. This section details three distinct augmentation strategies that enhance the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by dynamically integrating retrieval with generation processes.

The three subsections included under this conceptual umbrella are:

1. **Iterative Retrieval**: This process alternates between retrieval and generation phases, repeating up to $N$ times to refine the output iteratively. It enables progressive improvement of responses through successive rounds of information gathering and synthesis [rag-1].

2. **Recursive Retrieval**: This method decomposes complex problems into smaller sub-problems, applying iterative refinement at each level. It supports hierarchical reasoning and modular problem-solving within the RAG architecture [rag-1].

3. **Adaptive Retrieval**: In this approach, the Large Language Model (LLM) autonomously determines when and what information to retrieve using special tokens. This introduces a degree of self-regulation and context-awareness into the retrieval mechanism, allowing for more flexible and intelligent augmentation [rag-1].

These three augmentation processes are also visually represented in the *RAG_Augmentation_Processes_Flowchart* and referenced in *Fig. 5*, providing a schematic overview of how each strategy integrates into the broader RAG pipeline [rag-1].

In summary, while the exact section title “AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG” does not appear in the document, its functional equivalent is fully articulated in Section V through these three well-defined subsections: Iterative Retrieval, Recursive Retrieval, and Adaptive Retrieval.

    Although there is no explicit section titled 'AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG', the relevant content is covered under Section V, which details three key augmentation processes: Iterative Retrieval (alternates retrieval and generation up to N times), Recursive Retrieval (decomposes problems into sub-problems with iterative refinement), and Adaptive Retrieval (allows the LLM to autonomously decide when and what to retrieve using special tokens). These are also visualized in the RAG_Augmentation_Processes_Flowchart and referenced in Fig. 5.
