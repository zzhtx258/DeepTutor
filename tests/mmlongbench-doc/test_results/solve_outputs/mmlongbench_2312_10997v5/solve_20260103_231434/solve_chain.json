          "raw_answer": "In the context of the Augmentation Process in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the following subsections are defined as follows:\n\n### Iterative Retrieval\nIterative retrieval is a process that enhances the retrieval of information by repeatedly searching the knowledge base based on the initial user query and the text generated thus far. This method aims to provide large language models (LLMs) with a more comprehensive set of contextual references, thereby improving the robustness of answer generation. By allowing multiple retrieval cycles, it seeks to enrich the context iteratively. However, this approach can face challenges such as semantic discontinuity and irrelevant information accumulation. An example framework employing this technique is ITERRETGEN, which combines retrieval-enhanced generation with generation-enhanced retrieval for specific information reproduction tasks [1].\n\n### Recursive Retrieval\nRecursive retrieval involves refining search queries based on results from previous searches. It aims to enhance the relevance of search outcomes by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop. This technique is particularly beneficial for complex search scenarios where the user’s needs may not be immediately clear. Two notable applications of recursive retrieval are IRCoT, which utilizes a chain-of-thought approach to guide the retrieval process, and ToC, which constructs a clarification tree to systematically optimize ambiguous query components. This recursive nature facilitates continuous learning and adaptation, leading to improved user satisfaction with search results [1].\n\n### Adaptive Retrieval\nAdaptive retrieval methods allow large language models to autonomously decide when and what to retrieve based on their current context. This approach enhances the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced during the retrieval process. Exemplifying adaptive retrieval is the FLARE framework, which monitors the confidence of the generation process and activates retrieval only when necessary, ensuring that information is fetched at optimal times. Additionally, Self-RAG introduces reflection tokens that enable models to self-assess their outputs, deciding when to initiate retrieval autonomously. This flexibility contributes to a dynamic and context-aware retrieval process, making RAG systems more effective [1].\n\n### References\n- [1] 2312.10997v5.pdf",
