## S1: Determination of Paper Title Availability for Phrase-Level Retrieval Method (CoG [29])

The objective of this step is to ascertain whether the full title of the paper proposing the phrase-level retrieval granularity method — specifically referenced as **CoG [29]** — is available within the provided knowledge base.

Based on a comprehensive review of all available materials, including multiple RAG queries and tool execution results, it is confirmed that while the method **CoG [29]** is consistently described as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that operates at the **phrase-level** granularity and utilizes **Wikipedia** as its retrieval source [rag-1][rag-3], **no document or reference explicitly provides the full title of the paper associated with CoG [29]**.

Multiple attempts to extract the full title — including direct queries targeting the citation “CoG [29]” and searches within hypothetical bibliography sections — have yielded no success. The knowledge base consistently notes the absence of this information [rag-2][rag-4]. Furthermore, the tool execution result explicitly states:  
> “The full title of the paper proposing the method with phrase-level retrieval granularity (CoG [29]) is not available in the provided knowledge base.”  

This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that even when contextual details such as pre-training augmentation and iterative retrieval are mentioned [rag-3], the bibliographic metadata — specifically the full paper title — remains absent.

Therefore, based strictly on the evidence available and in accordance with the core principles of evidence-based reasoning, the full title of the paper proposing the phrase-level retrieval method (CoG [29]) is **not answerable** from the current knowledge base.

### Summary
Despite detailed descriptions of the CoG [29] method’s functionality and retrieval scope, the full title of the originating paper cannot be retrieved from the provided materials. All search efforts confirm the absence of this specific bibliographic information.
