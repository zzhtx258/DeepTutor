The knowledge base consistently notes the absence of this information [rag-2][rag-4]. Furthermore, the tool execution result explicitly states:  \n> “The full title of the paper proposing the method with phrase-level retrieval granularity (CoG [29]) is not available in the provided knowledge base.”  \n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the fact that even when contextual details such as pre-training augmentation and iterative retrieval are mentioned [rag-3], the bibliographic metadata — specifically the full paper title — remains absent.\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the evidence available and in accordance with the core principles of evidence-based reasoning, the full title of the paper proposing the phrase-level retrieval method (CoG [29]) is **not answerable** from the current knowledge base.\n\n### Summary\nDespite detailed descriptions of the CoG [29] method’s functionality and retrieval scope, the full title of the originating paper cannot be retrieved from the provided materials. All search efforts confirm the absence of this specific bibliographic information.",
