      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Icon Count in Figure 3\n\nTo determine the number of distinct icons used in **Figure 3**, we must evaluate whether this information can be derived from textual descriptions or if visual inspection is required.\n\nThe available materials — including multiple RAG-hybrid search results (`[rag-1]` through `[rag-6]`) — consistently describe **Figure 3** as a comparative diagram illustrating the three paradigms of RAG systems: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. These descriptions mention the use of “schematic nodes,” “arrows,” “color-coding,” and “iconography” to represent components such as “User Query,” “Search,” “Rerank,” etc. However, none of these sources provide an explicit count or enumeration of the distinct pictorial icons or symbols used in the figure.\n\nFurthermore, the tool execution result confirms that “the number of distinct icons in Figure 3 cannot be derived from available textual descriptions and requires visual inspection of the actual figure.” This aligns with the consistent absence of quantitative or qualitative icon specifications across all retrieved textual references.\n\nSince no textual source provides a list, description, or count of unique icons — and since no image file is available for direct visual analysis in this step — it is not possible to determine the number of distinct icons based solely on the current available materials.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question “In Figure 3, how many distinct icons are used?” is currently **not answerable** without access to the actual visual content of Figure 3.\n\n### Summary\nThe textual descriptions of Figure 3 reference its structure and components but do not specify the number or nature of distinct icons. Without visual access to the figure or more detailed metadata, the count cannot be determined from the provided materials.",
