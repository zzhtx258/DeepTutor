## S1: Identification of Buildings in the First Picture of the Knuckle Scrollshot Demonstration

In the demonstration illustrating how to use a knuckle gesture to capture a scrolling screenshot, the first image displayed on the smartphone screen is part of an application interface titled **“Europe Travel Itineraries”** [rag-1]. This interface showcases scenic visuals associated with different European travel destinations. Based on the visual content described in the materials, the following buildings and landmarks appear:

- **Eiffel Tower**: A globally recognized iron lattice tower located in Paris, France. It is visually linked to the “Charming France” itinerary section within the app [rag-1].
- **Pont Alexandre III**: An ornate bridge spanning the Seine River in Paris, noted for its Beaux-Arts architecture. Surprisingly, it appears under the “Swiss” itinerary entry in the demonstration, likely as a stylistic or thematic inclusion [rag-1].
- **Alpine Peaks**: While not a building per se, these snow-capped mountain ranges represent the alpine scenery characteristic of Switzerland and are included as part of the visual backdrop for the “Swiss” itinerary [rag-1].

These elements are presented as embedded images within the scrolling interface, serving both aesthetic and contextual purposes to enhance the user’s understanding of the destinations featured in the app.

### Summary
The first picture in the knuckle scrollshot demonstration displays three key visual elements: the Eiffel Tower (France), Pont Alexandre III (Parisian architecture under Swiss itinerary), and Alpine Peaks (representing Swiss alpine landscapes). These are shown as part of the “Europe Travel Itineraries” app interface, providing geographic and cultural context through imagery.
