      "raw_result": "In Pro Mode on the Huawei Nova Y70, the white balance (WB) function is adjusted by touching the \"WB·\" icon within the camera interface. According to the provided context, the Pro Mode interface displays adjustable camera parameters on the right side of the screen, including ISO, shutter speed, EV exposure compensation, focus mode, white balance, and storage format. The white balance setting is explicitly labeled as \"WB\" and is presented alongside other controls such as \"AF\" (auto focus) and \"S\" (shutter speed). However, the context does not specify a dedicated icon positioned directly to the right of the white balance function. Instead, the interface organizes these settings vertically, with each parameter represented by a label (e.g., \"WB·\") and an associated slider or selector.\n\nThe visual analysis of the Pro Mode screen (reference_id: 1) shows that white balance is displayed as a text label (\"WB\") with a selected mode (e.g., \"Cloudy\"), and no distinct icon appears immediately to its right. Adjacent settings such as storage format (\"HEIC\") appear below white balance, but no icon is described as being positioned directly to the right of the WB label. Therefore, while the white balance control is clearly identifiable as \"WB·\", there is no indication of a separate icon to its immediate right in the described interface layout.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",

The camera interface lists adjustable parameters vertically, with white balance followed below by settings like storage format, and no additional icon is described as appearing immediately adjacent to the white balance control.",

      "raw_result": "In the Huawei Nova Y70’s Pro Mode camera interface, the white balance (WB) setting is controlled via a dedicated icon labeled \"WB.\" Adjacent to this icon, users can adjust other key exposure parameters, including ISO sensitivity (labeled \"ISO\"), shutter speed (labeled \"S\"), and exposure compensation (labeled \"EV\"). These controls are arranged vertically on the right side of the screen, forming a panel of manual camera settings. The WB icon allows users to select preset modes such as \"Cloudy\" or \"Daylight,\" or manually adjust color temperature. The proximity of these icons — ISO, S, EV, and WB — enables photographers to fine-tune exposure and color balance simultaneously in low-light or challenging lighting conditions, as confirmed by visual analysis of the Pro Mode interface and supporting documentation.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",

      "raw_result": "In Huawei Nova Y70’s Pro Mode, the camera interface displays a vertical panel on the right side of the screen containing adjustable parameters. Based on the visual analysis of the Pro Mode interface, the sequence of icons and functions from top to bottom, adjacent to the white balance (WB) and ISO controls, is as follows:\n\n- **ISO sensitivity** is displayed first, represented by the label \"ISO\" with a slider to adjust values (e.g., set to 800 in the example).\n- Below ISO is **shutter speed**, indicated by the label \"S\" with a numerical value (e.g., 1/4s).\n- Next is **EV exposure compensation**, labeled \"EV\" with a slider (e.g., set to +1.0).\n- Then comes **white balance (WB)**, labeled \"WB\" with mode options such as \"Cloudy\" (as shown in the example).\n- Following WB is **focus mode**, labeled \"AF\" (Auto Focus), which allows selection between AF-S, AF-C, or MF.\n- Lastly, the **storage format** is selectable via an icon (e.g., set to \"HEIC\").\n\nThe icon sequence on the right side of the screen, therefore, proceeds as: **ISO → S (shutter speed) → EV → WB (white balance) → AF (focus mode) → storage format**. This layout enables users to sequentially adjust exposure parameters before capturing the image.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
