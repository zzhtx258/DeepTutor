      "raw_result": "In Pro Mode on the Huawei Nova Y70, the white balance (WB) function is adjusted by touching the \"WB·\" icon within the camera interface. According to the provided context, the Pro Mode interface displays adjustable camera parameters on the right side of the screen, including ISO, shutter speed, EV exposure compensation, focus mode, white balance, and storage format. The white balance setting is explicitly labeled as \"WB\" and is presented alongside other controls such as \"AF\" (auto focus) and \"S\" (shutter speed). However, the context does not specify a dedicated icon positioned directly to the right of the white balance function. Instead, the interface organizes these settings vertically, with each parameter represented by a label (e.g., \"WB·\") and an associated slider or selector.\n\nThe visual analysis of the Pro Mode screen (reference_id: 1) shows that white balance is displayed as a text label (\"WB\") with a selected mode (e.g., \"Cloudy\"), and no distinct icon appears immediately to its right. Adjacent settings such as storage format (\"HEIC\") appear below white balance, but no icon is described as being positioned directly to the right of the WB label. Therefore, while the white balance control is clearly identifiable as \"WB·\", there is no indication of a separate icon to its immediate right in the described interface layout.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",

Based on the visual analysis of the Pro Mode interface, the sequence of icons and functions from top to bottom, adjacent to the white balance (WB) and ISO controls, is as follows:\n\n- **ISO sensitivity** is displayed first, represented by the label \"ISO\" with a slider to adjust values (e.g., set to 800 in the example).\n- Below ISO is **shutter speed**, indicated by the label \"S\" with a numerical value (e.g., 1/4s).\n- Next is **EV exposure compensation**, labeled \"EV\" with a slider (e.g., set to +1.0).\n- Then comes **white balance (WB)**, labeled \"WB\" with mode options such as \"Cloudy\" (as shown in the example).\n- Following WB is **focus mode**, labeled \"AF\" (Auto Focus), which allows selection between AF-S, AF-C, or MF.\n- Lastly, the **storage format** is selectable via an icon (e.g., set to \"HEIC\").\n\nThe icon sequence on the right side of the screen, therefore, proceeds as: **ISO → S (shutter speed) → EV → WB (white balance) → AF (focus mode) → storage format**. This layout enables users to sequentially adjust exposure parameters before capturing the image.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The Huawei Nova Y70 Pro Mode camera interface, as visually documented in the provided context, displays a vertical panel of manual controls on the right side of the screen during Pro Mode activation. Based on the image analysis from reference_id:1, the sequence of icons in this panel includes, in order from top to bottom: ISO, Shutter Speed (S), EV Exposure Compensation, White Balance (WB), Focus Mode (AF·), and Storage Format (HEIC). \n\nThe icon immediately to the right of the White Balance (WB) icon is labeled **AF·**, which is the control element used to select the focus mode. According to the knowledge graph and supporting documentation, AF· allows users to choose between focus modes such as AF-S (single), AF-C (continuous), and MF (manual), as detailed in the “Pro Mode Focus Mode Usage Guide (table)” referenced in the context. This is further reinforced by instructional text on page 28 of the user guide, which directs users to touch AF· to adjust focus mode settings in Pro Mode.\n\nThere is no icon positioned directly to the *right* of WB in a horizontal layout — the interface is vertically arranged, and “to the right” in this context refers to the next item in the vertical sequence. The WB icon is followed by AF·, not ISO or any other setting, which appear above it. This sequence is consistent with Huawei’s design language as shown in the official interface image and corroborated by the table mapping focus modes to usage scenarios. Claims of ISO or other parameters appearing after WB are incorrect; ISO and EV are positioned above WB, while AF· is the direct successor.\n\nNo official Huawei documentation or interface layout from the Nova Y70 user guide suggests an alternative sequence or the absence of AF· after WB. The presence of AF· is confirmed as a required control in Pro Mode for professional-level focus customization, and its placement immediately after WB aligns with the logical grouping of exposure (ISO, S, EV) followed by focus and format settings.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
