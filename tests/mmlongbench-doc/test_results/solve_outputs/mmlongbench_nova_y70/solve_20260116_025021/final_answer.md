## S1: Function of the Icon on the Right-Hand Side of the Focus Mode Selector in Pro Mode

In Pro Mode, the icon positioned immediately to the right of the focus mode selector is identified as the **AF· Button** [rag-1]. This button serves as a dedicated interface for accessing and customizing autofocus behavior, enabling photographers to fine-tune focus performance according to their subject and shooting conditions.

Upon activation, the AF· Button allows users to cycle through three primary focus modes:
- **AF-S (Autofocus Single)**: Ideal for stationary subjects, where the camera locks focus once and maintains it until the shutter is released.
- **AF-C (Autofocus Continuous)**: Designed for moving subjects, continuously adjusting focus as the subject moves within the frame.
- **MF (Manual Focus)**: Grants full manual control over focus, allowing precise adjustments by tapping or dragging on the screen to select the desired focal point.

This functionality provides professional-grade control over focus dynamics, ensuring optimal sharpness whether capturing still portraits, fast-moving sports action, or creatively composed scenes requiring manual precision. The AF· Button thus acts as a gateway to advanced focusing strategies, directly enhancing creative flexibility and technical accuracy in Pro Mode photography [rag-1].

The presence of this button reflects a design philosophy centered on empowering users with granular control — a hallmark of professional imaging tools. By placing it adjacent to the focus mode selector, the interface encourages intuitive interaction, allowing rapid switching between focus behaviors without navigating complex menus.

In summary, the icon on the right-hand side of the focus mode selector in Pro Mode is not merely decorative but functionally critical: it is the **AF· Button**, granting direct access to dynamic focus control options essential for professional-level photography.
