      "raw_result": "In relation to **Device+**, the following non-phone devices are mentioned:\n\n- **Vision Product**: These are HUAWEI-compatible display or smart devices that can be linked with a phone via Device+ for task transfer and control. They can receive transferred tasks such as MeeTime calls, videos, or music playback from a phone.\n  \n- **Vision**: A specific Huawei-supported device (likely a subset or example of Vision Products) that can receive transferred tasks like MeeTime calls, videos, or music from a phone via Device+.\n\n- **Bluetooth Devices**: These include headsets, speakers, or other peripherals that can be connected to a phone via Bluetooth for audio playback or Device+ integration. Specifically, **Bluetooth Headset** is noted as a device that can receive audio streams like music through Device+.\n\nThese devices enable seamless collaboration and task transfer with a Huawei phone using the Device+ feature, provided they are on the same Wi-Fi network and logged into the same HUAWEI ID.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Vision Product\n- [2] Vision\n- [3] Bluetooth Device\n- [4] Bluetooth Headset",
      "summary": "Besides phones, Device+ supports integration with non-phone devices including Vision Products (such as smart displays), the specific Vision device for receiving MeeTime calls and media, and Bluetooth peripherals like headsets and speakers for audio streaming. These devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network and logged into the same HUAWEI ID to enable seamless task transfer and control.",
