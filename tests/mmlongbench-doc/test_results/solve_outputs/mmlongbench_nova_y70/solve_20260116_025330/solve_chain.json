These devices must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network and logged into the same HUAWEI ID to ensure synchronized task transfer and control capabilities.\n\nBased on the available materials, the following categories of non-phone devices are explicitly supported:\n\n### 1. Vision Products\nThese include smart displays or compatible HUAWEI display devices that can receive and manage transferred tasks from a phone. For instance, users can seamlessly transfer MeeTime calls, videos, or music playback to these devices for enhanced viewing or listening experiences [rag-1].\n\n### 2. Bluetooth Peripherals\nThis category includes audio-enabled accessories such as:\n- Bluetooth headsets\n- Bluetooth speakers\n\nThese peripherals allow for audio streaming and hands-free communication when integrated with Device+, enhancing user convenience during media consumption or calls [rag-1].\n\nAll listed devices must meet the prerequisite of being on the same Wi-Fi network and associated with the same HUAWEI ID account to enable full functionality within the Device+ ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, Device+ extends its intelligent connectivity beyond phones to include Vision Products and Bluetooth audio peripherals — enabling a unified, multi-device experience across HUAWEI’s ecosystem.",
