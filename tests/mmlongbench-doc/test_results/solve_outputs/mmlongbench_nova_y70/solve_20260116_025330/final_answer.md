## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification of Non-Phone Devices Supported by Device+

To set up **Device+**, HUAWEI enables seamless cross-device interaction not only with smartphones but also with a range of non-phone devices. These devices must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network and logged into the same HUAWEI ID to ensure synchronized task transfer and control capabilities.

Based on the available materials, the following categories of non-phone devices are explicitly supported:

### 1. Vision Products
These include smart displays or compatible HUAWEI display devices that can receive and manage transferred tasks from a phone. For instance, users can seamlessly transfer MeeTime calls, videos, or music playback to these devices for enhanced viewing or listening experiences [rag-1].

### 2. Bluetooth Peripherals
This category includes audio-enabled accessories such as:
- Bluetooth headsets
- Bluetooth speakers

These peripherals allow for audio streaming and hands-free communication when integrated with Device+, enhancing user convenience during media consumption or calls [rag-1].

All listed devices must meet the prerequisite of being on the same Wi-Fi network and associated with the same HUAWEI ID account to enable full functionality within the Device+ ecosystem.

In summary, Device+ extends its intelligent connectivity beyond phones to include Vision Products and Bluetooth audio peripherals — enabling a unified, multi-device experience across HUAWEI’s ecosystem.
