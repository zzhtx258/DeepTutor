They can receive transferred tasks such as MeeTime calls, videos, or music playback from a phone.\n  \n- **Vision**: A specific Huawei-supported device (likely a subset or example of Vision Products) that can receive transferred tasks like MeeTime calls, videos, or music from a phone via Device+.\n\n- **Bluetooth Devices**: These include headsets, speakers, or other peripherals that can be connected to a phone via Bluetooth for audio playback or Device+ integration. Specifically, **Bluetooth Headset** is noted as a device that can receive audio streams like music through Device+.\n\nThese devices enable seamless collaboration and task transfer with a Huawei phone using the Device+ feature, provided they are on the same Wi-Fi network and logged into the same HUAWEI ID.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Vision Product\n- [2] Vision\n- [3] Bluetooth Device\n- [4] Bluetooth Headset",
