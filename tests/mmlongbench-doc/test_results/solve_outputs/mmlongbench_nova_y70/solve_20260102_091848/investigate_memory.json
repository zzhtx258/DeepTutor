      "raw_result": "The Huawei Nova Y70 user guide includes a comprehensive set of notification and system status icons that reflect active device states, connectivity conditions, and user alerts. These icons are primarily displayed in the status bar and Control Panel, allowing users to quickly interpret device conditions at a glance.\n\nThe icons are organized into functional categories. For network and connectivity status, the guide lists indicators such as **5G network connected**, **4G network connected**, **Wi-Fi connected**, **Wi-Fi 6 connected**, and **Wi-Fi 6+ connected**, each paired with their respective fault states (e.g., “Wi-Fi network is faulty, unable to connect to the Internet”). Additionally, icons for **Hotspot enabled** and **Hotspot connected** distinguish between the device acting as a hotspot versus being connected to one. Cellular indicators include **Roaming**, **No SIM card inserted**, and **Data saver enabled**, while network hierarchy is clearly depicted from 5G down to 2G. The **Airplane mode is ON** icon is represented by an arrow symbol (→), and battery-related icons include **Charging**, **Quick charging**, **Super charging**, and **Wireless super charging**, with distinct symbols for **Battery empty** and **Low battery power**.\n\nNotification and alert indicators are also detailed, including **Missed call**, **There are unread messages**, **New email**, and **More notifications**, which suggest layered alert hierarchies. System modes such as **Power Saving mode on**, **Do Not Disturb mode enabled**, **Silent mode**, and **Vibration** are listed as toggleable states, aligning with the Control Panel’s shortcut switches. Other status indicators include **Bluetooth enabled**, **Bluetooth device battery**, **Bluetooth device connected OT**, **VPN connected**, **Location service enabled**, **Eye Comfort enabled**, **Headset connected**, **Headset with a microphone connected**, **In call HD**, and **VoLTE enabled**. The table also includes **Syncing...** and **Syncing failed** to indicate real-time data synchronization status, and **Event reminder** and **Performance mode enabled √** (with a checkmark) to denote active user-configured settings.\n\nThese icons are designed to be intuitive and consistent with the device’s interface philosophy, as confirmed by the guide’s emphasis on visual feedback and gesture-based interaction. Some icons, such as those for network modes or charging, may vary slightly depending on region or service provider, as noted in the documentation. The presence of Chinese characters like '合' and '四' in certain rows suggests possible category groupings, though their exact meaning remains contextually ambiguous without visual reference.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
      "summary": "The Huawei Nova Y70 user guide lists multiple distinct notification and status icons displayed in the status bar and Control Panel. These include network indicators (5G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6+, hotspot, roaming, no SIM, data saver), battery states (charging, quick charging, super charging, wireless super charging, battery empty, low battery), alert icons (missed call, unread messages, new email, more notifications), system modes (airplane mode, power saving, do not disturb, silent, vibration), connectivity icons (Bluetooth enabled, Bluetooth device connected, VPN connected, location service, eye comfort, headset connected, HD call, VoLTE), and synchronization status (syncing, syncing failed). Additional icons include event reminders and performance mode enabled. The guide emphasizes intuitive design and visual feedback, with some icons potentially varying by region or provider.",

      "raw_result": "The Huawei Nova Y70 user guide provides multiple tables and visual analyses that catalog system status and notification icons across various contexts, including network connectivity, charging states, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, audio control, accessibility features, and more. These icons are presented in structured tables and image analyses, primarily in the “EÑì²fiì²ÑÊ and Status Icons” and “Control Panel” sections.\n\nBy synthesizing the distinct icons listed across the provided document chunks, the following categories and their associated unique status/notification icons can be identified:\n\n### Network & Connectivity Icons\n- 5G network connected  \n- 4G network connected  \n- 3G network connected  \n- 2G network connected  \n- Full signal strength  \n- Roaming  \n- No SIM card inserted  \n- Hotspot enabled  \n- Hotspot disconnected  \n- Switching network via Wi-Fi+  \n- Wi-Fi connected  \n- Wi-Fi network is faulty, unable to connect to the Internet  \n- Wi-Fi 6 connected  \n- Wi-Fi 6 network is faulty, unable to connect to the Internet  \n- Wi-Fi 6+ connected  \n- Wi-Fi 6+ network is faulty, unable to connect to the Internet  \n- Airplane mode is ON  \n- Data saver enabled  \n\n### Charging & Battery Icons\n- Battery empty  \n- Low battery power  \n- Charging  \n- Quick charging  \n- Super charging  \n- Wireless super charging  \n\n### Bluetooth & Audio Icons\n- Bluetooth enabled  \n- Bluetooth device battery  \n- Bluetooth device connected  \n- Headset connected  \n- Headset with a microphone connected  \n- In call HD  \n- VoLTE enabled  \n- Wireless fast charging  \n- Regular wireless charging  \n\n### System & Mode Icons\n- Driving mode  \n- Projection device connected  \n- Location service enabled  \n- Eye Comfort enabled  \n- Silent mode  \n- Vibration  \n- Do Not Disturb mode enabled  \n- NFC enabled  \n- Syncing...  \n- Syncing failed  \n- Performance mode enabled √  \n- Event reminder  \n- More notifications  \n- Missed call  \n- There are unread messages  \n- New email  \n\n### Device Interaction & Control Panel Icons\n- Power off and restart  \n- Turn up volume  \n- Turn down volume  \n- Take a screenshot (via buttons)  \n- Return to previous screen  \n- Back to home screen  \n- Recent tasks  \n- Close an app  \n- Switch between apps (slide across bottom)  \n- Knuckle screenshot (via gesture)  \n- Knuckle scrollshot (draw “S”)  \n- Knuckle partial screenshot (draw enclosed area)  \n- Device+ available devices  \n- Audio playback card  \n- Audio device selection icon  \n\n### Camera & Pro Mode Icons\n- Matrix metering  \n- Center metering  \n- Spot metering  \n- AF-S (single focus)  \n- AF-C (continuous focus)  \n- MF (manual focus)  \n\n### Other Status Indicators\n- Alarm set  \n- Screen wake (Raise to wake, Double-tap to wake, Show palm to wake — though these are settings, their enabled states may appear as indicators)  \n- Face unlock (implied as status when active)  \n- Fingerprint unlock (implied as status when active)  \n- App Lock (implied through lock icons on apps)  \n\nSome icons are contextually implied (e.g., Face Unlock, Fingerprint Unlock) but are not explicitly rendered as status bar icons in the tables. The tables and analyses list only those explicitly described as visual indicators in the UI.\n\nCounting all explicitly named, unique status and notification icons from the tables and analyses — excluding duplicates and settings toggles that are not visual indicators — yields a total of **58 distinct icons**.\n\nThese icons are documented across multiple tables in the guide, including those describing network states, charging, Bluetooth, system modes, gestures, and audio controls. The guide emphasizes that some icons may vary by region or device model, but the above list reflects all distinct icons explicitly presented in the provided context.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
