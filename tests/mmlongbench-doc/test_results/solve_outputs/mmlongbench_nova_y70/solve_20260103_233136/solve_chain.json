      "step_response": "## S1: Function of the Icon Next to White Balance in Pro Mode Shooting\n\nIn Pro Mode shooting on the Huawei Nova Y70, the icon located next to the white balance (WB) setting plays a crucial role in enhancing the photographic experience by allowing users to select specific white balance modes. This functionality is essential for adjusting the color temperature of images based on varying lighting conditions.\n\nWhen users touch this icon, they can choose from various white balance presets tailored to different environments, such as daylight, cloudy, tungsten, or fluorescent. Each mode is designed to compensate for the color cast introduced by different light sources. For instance, selecting the \"daylight\" mode will help neutralize the warm tones produced by incandescent lighting, while the \"cloudy\" mode can enhance warmth in overcast conditions, ensuring that colors are represented accurately in photographs.\n\nThis adjustment is vital for achieving true-to-life colors, as improper white balance can lead to images that appear too warm (yellow/orange) or too cool (blue). By utilizing the icon next to the white balance setting, photographers can ensure that their images reflect the intended colors of the scene, thereby improving the overall quality and aesthetic of their photographs. \n\nIn summary, the icon next to the white balance setting in Pro Mode is a powerful tool for photographers, enabling precise control over color temperature and enhancing the accuracy of color representation in various lighting environments.",
