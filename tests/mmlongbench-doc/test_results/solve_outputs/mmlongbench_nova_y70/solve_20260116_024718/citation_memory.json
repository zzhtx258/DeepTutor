      "raw_result": "The guidebook displays notification and status icons across several key pages and sections, primarily focused on user interface navigation and system status awareness. These include:\n\n- **Pages 6–8**: These pages explicitly reference the use of status icons for real-time device monitoring. They are tied to operations such as screen unlocking and control panel usage, helping users interpret battery, network, and connectivity states.\n\n- **Control Panel Interface**: This section details how status icons appear in the Control Panel — a dropdown menu accessed by swiping down from the upper right edge of the screen. It includes icons for Bluetooth, NFC, Driving Mode, Do Not Disturb, Wi-Fi, Location Services, Eye Comfort, and more. The Control Panel also indicates notifications such as “More Notifications,” “Unread Messages,” “New Email,” “Missed Call,” and “Event Reminder.”\n\n- **Status Icons Table**: A structured 3-column, 14-row table that maps visual icons to their functional meanings. This table covers system statuses like alarm set, no SIM card, data saver enabled, Wi-Fi fault, and battery indicators (empty, low, charging, super charging, wireless super charging). It is referenced in relation to both the smartphone interface and the Control Panel.\n\n- **Device Status Icon Reference Table (table)**: This table supports user comprehension of device status during core interactions like screen unlocking and home screen customization. It integrates with the Status Icons Table and appears in context with pages 6–8.\n\n- **Notification Panel**: Displayed by swiping down from the upper left edge of the screen, this panel shows pending or unread notifications. It is visually supported by the Smartphone Gesture Instructions Table (image), which illustrates swipe gestures for accessing panels.\n\n- **Smartphone Interface**: As the overarching UI context, it displays status icons in the top bar (status bar) and within interactive panels like the Control Panel and Notification Panel. The minimalist monochromatic icon may also appear here to indicate disabled or unsupported features (e.g., Multi-Window or Floating Window).\n\nThese sections collectively ensure users can interpret real-time device states and respond appropriately through visual cues and gesture-based navigation.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Device Status Icon Reference Table (table)\n- [2] Control Panel Interface\n- [3] Status Icons Table\n- [4] Smartphone Interface\n- [5] Notification Panel",
