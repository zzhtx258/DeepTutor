      "step_response": "## S1: Identification and Count of Distinct Notification and Status Icons\n\nTo determine the total number of distinct notification and status icons displayed in the guidebook, we begin by examining the primary source referenced across multiple sections: the **Status Icons Table**. This table, described as a 3-column grid with 14 rows, appears on pages 6–8 and serves as the authoritative reference for icon meanings and categories [rag-1].\n\nAlthough the table’s header contains corrupted text and visual representations are stored externally as image files (e.g., SHA-256-named JPGs), the textual content within the table provides sufficient detail to enumerate the distinct icons. According to the detailed breakdown provided in the materials, the 57 distinct icons are distributed across 8 functional categories:\n\n| Category                  | Number of Icons |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| Battery Power             | 8               |\n| Network Connectivity      | 8               |\n| Connectivity Modes        | 4               |\n| System Statuses           | 6               |\n| Notifications & Alerts    | 6               |\n| Audio & Mode Settings     | 10              |\n| Device & Feature States   | 12              |\n| Visual Notes              | 3               |\n\nThis categorization confirms that the total count of distinct icons is not merely the 14 rows of the table — which might suggest 14 entries — but rather the sum of all unique icons across these functional groupings, totaling **57 distinct icons** [rag-3].\n\nIt is important to note that while additional icons may appear in other sections such as the Control Panel Interface, Notification Panel, or Smartphone Interface, no separate or overlapping icons are specified beyond those enumerated in the Status Icons Table. Therefore, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the 57 icons from the table represent the complete set of distinct notification and status icons referenced in the guidebook.\n\nIn summary, based on the structured data provided in the Status Icons Table and corroborated by cross-referenced sections, the guidebook displays **57 distinct notification and status icons**.",
