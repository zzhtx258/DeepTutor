According to the provided context, Device+ allows the phone to act as a hub for the following types of devices:\n\n- **Vision**: Huawei Vision smart displays can be linked with the phone, provided they are connected to the same local network (LAN) and logged in to the same HUAWEI ID as the phone. Tasks such as MeeTime calls, videos, and music can be transferred to Vision devices.\n  \n- **Bluetooth devices**: Certain Bluetooth devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, can be linked via Device+ after establishing a Bluetooth connection. Music playback can be transferred to these devices, even when their screens are off.\n\nIt is explicitly noted that Device+ does not support collaboration between two phones. Additionally, to use Device+, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be enabled on the phone, and all connected devices must be logged in to the same HUAWEI ID.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
