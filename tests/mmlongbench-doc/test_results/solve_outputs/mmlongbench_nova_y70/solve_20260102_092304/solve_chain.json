      "step_response": "## S1: Identifying Non-Phone Devices Supported by Huawei Device+\n\nThe core intent of the question is to identify non-phone devices that can be integrated with Huawei Device+ to enable seamless cross-device connectivity and task transfer—explicitly excluding smartphones as per the constraint. Based on the provided knowledge base materials, Huawei Device+ facilitates interoperability between a Huawei phone and two primary categories of non-phone devices: **Huawei Vision smart displays** and **Bluetooth headsets** [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3].\n\nHuawei Vision smart displays function as extended interactive surfaces, allowing users to mirror or extend phone content such as video streams, MeeTime calls, and multimedia playback directly onto a larger screen. For this connection to activate, both the phone and the Vision device must be connected to the same local area network (LAN) and authenticated under the same HUAWEI ID [rag-1][rag-2]. This ensures secure, context-aware handoff between devices.\n\nSimilarly, Bluetooth headsets—such as Huawei’s own freebuds or compatible third-party models—can be paired via Bluetooth to enable audio task transfer. For instance, a user can seamlessly transition music or call audio from their phone to a paired headset without manual reconnection, enhancing mobility and convenience [rag-2][rag-3]. Unlike Vision devices, Bluetooth headsets do not require network-level synchronization but must be explicitly paired through the phone’s Bluetooth settings.\n\nImportantly, Device+ is designed as a phone-centric ecosystem: it does not support direct collaboration between two phones, reinforcing the phone’s role as the central hub for managing peripheral devices [rag-1]. This architecture ensures a unified user experience where the phone orchestrates interactions with non-phone endpoints.\n\nIn summary, the only non-phone device categories officially supported by Huawei Device+ for seamless task transfer are **Huawei Vision smart displays** and **Bluetooth headsets**, each requiring distinct but well-defined connection protocols to function within the ecosystem.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Consolidation and Validation of Supported Non-Phone Device Categories\n\nTo ensure accuracy and eliminate redundancy, the supported non-phone device types for Huawei Device+ have been systematically extracted and cross-validated across all available knowledge sources [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3]. Each source explicitly identifies only two categories of non-phone devices: **Huawei Vision smart displays** and **Bluetooth headsets**. No other device types—such as tablets, laptops, wearables, or smart home appliances—are mentioned in any of the provided materials.\n\nThe consistency across sources is complete and unambiguous:\n- [rag-1] states that Device+ enables connection with “Huawei Vision smart displays and Bluetooth headsets” as non-phone endpoints, emphasizing the phone’s role as a central hub [rag-1].\n- [rag-2] reiterates the same two categories, further clarifying that Vision devices require LAN and HUAWEI ID synchronization, while Bluetooth devices require explicit pairing [rag-2].\n- [rag-3] confirms identical terminology and conditions, reinforcing that these are the *only* supported device types under the Device+ framework [rag-3].\n\nImportantly, no source introduces additional categories, nor do any sources contradict one another. The tool execution result further validates this conclusion by explicitly summarizing: *“The non-phone devices supported by Huawei Device+ are Huawei Vision smart displays and Bluetooth headsets. This is consistently stated across all knowledge sources, with no redundancy or contradiction.”* This confirms that the set of supported devices is both exhaustive and non-overlapping within the provided context.\n\nFurthermore, the requirement for network and account synchronization (same LAN and HUAWEI ID) applies uniformly to Vision devices across all sources, while Bluetooth headsets are consistently described as requiring only Bluetooth pairing—highlighting a clear distinction in connection protocols, but not in device classification.\n\nThus, after rigorous consolidation and validation, the only non-phone device types officially supported by Huawei Device+ are **Huawei Vision smart displays** and **Bluetooth headsets**, with no exceptions or additional categories present in the evidence base.\n\nThe analysis confirms a clean, consistent, and fully supported two-category model for non-phone device integration under Huawei Device+.",
