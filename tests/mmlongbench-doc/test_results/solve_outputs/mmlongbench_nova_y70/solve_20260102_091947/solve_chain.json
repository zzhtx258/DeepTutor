      "step_response": "## S1: Identifying the Function of the Icon to the Right of the Focus Mode Selection in Pro Mode\n\nIn the Pro Mode camera interface of the Huawei Nova Y70, users are presented with a suite of manual controls designed to fine-tune image capture under varying conditions. One such control is the **focus mode selection icon**, typically labeled “AF” (Auto Focus), which allows the user to choose between different focusing strategies such as single-shot, continuous, or manual focus [rag-3].\n\nImmediately to the right of this AF icon lies a distinct symbol—this is the **white balance (WB) control icon** [rag-3]. White balance is a critical photographic parameter that adjusts the color temperature of the image to ensure accurate color reproduction under different lighting environments. Without proper white balance, images may appear unnaturally warm (yellow/orange) under incandescent light or cool (blue) under shade or overcast skies [rag-3].\n\nBy tapping the WB icon, users can select from several preset modes, including “Daylight,” “Cloudy,” “Incandescent,” “Fluorescent,” and “Auto,” each optimized for specific lighting conditions. Additionally, the interface permits manual adjustment of color temperature along a Kelvin scale (typically ranging from 2000K to 10000K), allowing advanced users to precisely calibrate the tint of the image to match the ambient light [rag-3]. This level of control is essential in professional photography, where color fidelity directly impacts the quality and intent of the final image.\n\nIn summary, the icon positioned to the right of the focus mode selector serves as the **white balance (WB) control**, enabling both preset and manual adjustment of color temperature to achieve natural and consistent color rendering across diverse lighting scenarios [rag-3].",

      "step_response": "## S2: Evaluating the UI Layout of Focus Mode Control in Huawei Pro Mode\n\nThe previous step identified the icon to the right of the focus mode selector as the white balance (WB) control [rag-3]. However, this conclusion must now be reconciled with the actual UI structure of the Huawei Nova Y70’s Pro Mode, as defined by direct interface observations [rag-1]. According to the verified UI specification, the focus mode is **not** selected via a dedicated icon, but rather through a **text-based label** labeled `'AF·'` displayed directly within the camera interface [rag-1]. Tapping this `'AF·'` label opens an inline menu allowing selection between three focus modes: `AF-S` (Auto Focus Single), `AF-C` (Auto Focus Continuous), and `MF` (Manual Focus) [rag-1].\n\nCritically, there is **no separate icon** positioned to the right of the `'AF·'` label for the purpose of focus mode selection. The control is entirely text-driven and self-contained—when a mode is selected, the label updates in place (e.g., changing from `'AF·'` to `'AF-C·'` or `'MF·'`) to reflect the current setting [rag-1]. This design choice emphasizes minimalism and space efficiency in the Pro Mode UI, where each on-screen element must serve multiple functions without visual clutter.\n\nThis directly contradicts the earlier assumption that a graphical icon (e.g., a target or lens symbol) exists adjacent to the focus mode control. Instead, the element immediately to the right of `'AF·'` is indeed the **white balance (WB) icon**, as previously described—but it is unrelated to focus mode selection. The WB icon is a distinct, separate control, positioned after the focus mode text label, confirming a sequential layout:  \n**[AF·] → [WB icon]**  \nwhere the first is a text toggle and the second is a graphical control.\n\nThus, the UI layout adheres strictly to the following structure:  \n- Focus mode is controlled **only** via the `'AF·'` text label.  \n- No icon exists for focus mode selection; any icon to its right belongs to a different function (WB).  \n- The system does not use dual controls (icon + text) for focus mode—only text.\n\nThis clarification ensures accurate user interaction: users must tap the `'AF·'` text—not an adjacent icon—to change focus modes, reinforcing the importance of reading UI labels over assuming icon-based conventions.\n\nIn summary, the focus mode in Huawei Pro Mode is exclusively managed through the text label `'AF·'`, with no dedicated icon for selection to its right. The icon immediately following it serves solely as the white balance control, confirming a clear, sequential, and functionally distinct UI layout [rag-1].",

      "step_response": "## S3: Identifying and Functionally Analyzing the WB Icon to the Right of the Focus Mode Label\n\nHaving established in S2 that the focus mode in Huawei Pro Mode is controlled exclusively via the text label `'AF·'`—and not by any graphical icon—the element immediately to its right must be evaluated as a distinct, independent control. Based on verified interface specifications and user documentation, this element is a **graphical icon labeled \"WB\"**, clearly denoting **White Balance** [rag-2].\n\nThe **White Balance (WB)** function is a fundamental photographic parameter that corrects color casts introduced by varying light sources, ensuring that white objects appear truly white under any illumination [rag-2]. Without proper WB adjustment, scenes captured under tungsten lighting may appear overly orange, while those under shade or fluorescent lighting may exhibit an unnatural blue or green tint. In Pro Mode, the WB icon provides users with precise control over this critical aspect of image rendering.\n\nTapping the **\"WB\"** icon opens a menu offering both **preset modes** and **manual Kelvin adjustment**:\n- **Preset modes** include: *Auto*, *Daylight*, *Cloudy*, *Incandescent*, and *Fluorescent*, each calibrated to optimize color accuracy under common lighting conditions [rag-2].\n- **Manual mode** allows users to fine-tune the color temperature along a continuous scale from **2000K** (warm, orange) to **10000K** (cool, blue), enabling professional-grade color calibration tailored to specific environments [rag-2].\n\nThis dual-mode flexibility—preset for speed and manual for precision—aligns with the Pro Mode’s design philosophy of empowering users with granular control over exposure parameters. The placement of the WB icon directly adjacent to the `'AF·'` label reflects a logical UI hierarchy: first, the user selects *what to focus on* (focus mode), then *how the colors should appear* (white balance), mirroring the natural workflow of manual photography.\n\nImportantly, the WB icon is **not** a focus-related control; it is a purely color-temperature adjustment tool. Its distinct graphical design (typically represented by a small sun or thermometer symbol with a color gradient) differentiates it from the text-based focus selector, reinforcing functional separation in the interface.\n\nThus, the icon positioned to the right of the focus mode selection label is unequivocally the **White Balance (WB) control**, serving to adjust color temperature settings through preset modes or manual Kelvin values, ensuring accurate and intentional color reproduction across diverse lighting conditions [rag-2].\n\nIn summary, the \"WB\" icon to the right of `'AF·'` is a dedicated, non-focus-related control for color temperature adjustment, providing both preset and manual options to achieve natural color fidelity in professional-grade photography.",

This icon, typically represented by a stylized sun or thermometer with a color gradient, enables users to select from preset modes such as *Auto*, *Daylight*, *Cloudy*, *Incandescent*, and *Fluorescent*, or to manually set a precise color temperature along the Kelvin scale ranging from **2000K** to **10000K** [rag-2]. This functionality ensures accurate and intentional color reproduction under diverse lighting conditions—a critical feature for professional-grade photography [rag-2].\n\nCrucially, **no separate icon exists for selecting focus mode**. The focus mode is controlled exclusively through the **text-based label `'AF·'`**, which dynamically updates in place when a mode is selected (e.g., switching to `'AF-C·'` or `'MF·'`) [rag-1]. This design eliminates visual redundancy and adheres to a minimalist interface philosophy, where focus mode is not signaled by an icon but by contextual text. Therefore, the element to the right of `'AF·'` cannot be a focus mode selector—it is, by both design and function, the WB icon.\n\nThis sequential layout—**`[AF·] → [WB icon]`**—reflects a logical photographic workflow: first, determine *what* is in focus (via text label), then determine *how colors should appear* (via graphical WB control). The functional and visual separation between these two controls reinforces user clarity and prevents misinterpretation.\n\nIn summary, the icon to the right of the focus mode selection in Huawei Pro Mode is the **White Balance (WB) icon**, used exclusively for color temperature adjustment. There is **no icon** for focus mode selection to its right—the focus mode is managed solely through the text label `'AF·'`. This conclusion is grounded in verified UI specifications and aligns with professional camera interface design principles.",
