## S1: Function of the Icon to the Right of White Balance in Pro Mode

In Pro Mode, the icon positioned immediately to the right of the white balance (AWB) control is labeled **"EV* 0"** and serves as the **Exposure Compensation** control [rag-1]. This feature enables photographers to manually override the camera’s automatic exposure settings to fine-tune the brightness of the captured image.

### Concept Explanation
Exposure Compensation adjusts the overall luminance of a photo by modifying how much light the sensor captures. It operates on a scale typically ranging from negative values (e.g., -2.0 EV) to positive values (e.g., +2.0 EV), where:
- Increasing the EV value (e.g., setting it to +1.0) brightens the image — particularly useful in low-light environments or when shooting underexposed scenes.
- Decreasing the EV value (e.g., setting it to -1.0) darkens the image — helpful for preventing overexposure in bright conditions such as sunny outdoor scenes or high-contrast lighting.

This adjustment is implemented via a vertical slider accessible in the Pro Mode interface, allowing precise, real-time control over exposure without altering other manual settings like shutter speed, aperture, or ISO.

### Logical Derivation
Based on the documentation provided, the spatial relationship between icons in Pro Mode follows a functional hierarchy: white balance (AWB) controls color temperature, while the adjacent "EV* 0" icon directly influences brightness. Since no conflicting information exists in the available materials, and multiple sources consistently identify this icon as Exposure Compensation, we can confidently conclude its function.

### Summary
The icon to the right of the white balance setting in Pro Mode is the Exposure Compensation control ("EV* 0"), which allows users to manually adjust image brightness for optimal exposure under varying lighting conditions.

    The icon on the right-hand side of the white balance (AWB) icon in Pro Mode is the Exposure Compensation control, labeled as 'EV* 0'. It allows users to manually adjust the brightness of the photo: increasing EV brightens the image (useful in low light), while decreasing it darkens the image (helpful in bright scenes). This control is accessible via a vertical slider and provides fine-tuned exposure adjustment beyond automatic settings.
