      "raw_result": "The icon on the right-hand side of the white balance (AWB) icon in Pro Mode is the **Exposure Compensation** control, labeled as **\"EV* 0\"**.\n\nThis setting allows users to manually adjust the brightness of the photo. Increasing the EV value brightens the image (useful in low-light conditions), while decreasing it darkens the image (helpful in overly bright scenes). It provides fine-tuned control over exposure beyond automatic settings.\n\nThis control is accessible via a vertical slider in the PRO camera mode interface and is part of the manual photographic parameters that Pro Mode offers for advanced image capture.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Smartphone Pro Camera Mode Interface Guide (image)\n- [2] Pro Mode\n- [3] Exposure Compensation\n- [4] PRO Camera Mode\n- [5] EV Exposure Compensation",
