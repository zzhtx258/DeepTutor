      "step_response": "## S1: Function of the Icon to the Right of White Balance in Pro Mode\n\nIn Pro Mode, the icon positioned immediately to the right of the white balance (AWB) control is labeled **\"EV* 0\"** and serves as the **Exposure Compensation** control [rag-1]. This feature enables photographers to manually override the camera’s automatic exposure settings to fine-tune the brightness of the captured image.\n\n### Concept Explanation\nExposure Compensation adjusts the overall luminance of a photo by modifying how much light the sensor captures. It operates on a scale typically ranging from negative values (e.g., -2.0 EV) to positive values (e.g., +2.0 EV), where:\n- Increasing the EV value (e.g., setting it to +1.0) brightens the image — particularly useful in low-light environments or when shooting underexposed scenes.\n- Decreasing the EV value (e.g., setting it to -1.0) darkens the image — helpful for preventing overexposure in bright conditions such as sunny outdoor scenes or high-contrast lighting.\n\nThis adjustment is implemented via a vertical slider accessible in the Pro Mode interface, allowing precise, real-time control over exposure without altering other manual settings like shutter speed, aperture, or ISO.\n\n### Logical Derivation\nBased on the documentation provided, the spatial relationship between icons in Pro Mode follows a functional hierarchy: white balance (AWB) controls color temperature, while the adjacent \"EV* 0\" icon directly influences brightness. Since no conflicting information exists in the available materials, and multiple sources consistently identify this icon as Exposure Compensation, we can confidently conclude its function.\n\n### Summary\nThe icon to the right of the white balance setting in Pro Mode is the Exposure Compensation control (\"EV* 0\"), which allows users to manually adjust image brightness for optimal exposure under varying lighting conditions.",
