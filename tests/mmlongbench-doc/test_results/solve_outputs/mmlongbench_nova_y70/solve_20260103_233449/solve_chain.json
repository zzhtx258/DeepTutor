Specifically, it supports two main types of devices: **Vision Devices** and **Bluetooth Devices**.\n\n### Vision Devices\nVision Devices are specialized products that must be connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as the phone and logged into the same HUAWEI ID. This connectivity allows for seamless interaction and control, enabling users to leverage the capabilities of these devices in conjunction with their smartphones. The requirement for the same LAN and HUAWEI ID ensures that the devices can communicate effectively and share resources.\n\n### Bluetooth Devices\nIn addition to Vision Devices, Device+ also supports Bluetooth Devices, such as Bluetooth headsets. These devices can be paired with the phone through a Bluetooth connection, allowing for audio streaming and other functionalities that enhance the user experience. The flexibility of Bluetooth connectivity means that users can easily integrate various accessories into their Device+ ecosystem.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, Device+ enhances collaborative functionality by supporting Vision Devices that require a specific network setup and Bluetooth Devices that can connect wirelessly. This integration allows users to maximize their device capabilities and create a more interconnected digital environment.",
