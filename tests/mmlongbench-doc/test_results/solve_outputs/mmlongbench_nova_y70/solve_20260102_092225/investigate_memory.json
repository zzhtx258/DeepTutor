      "raw_result": "The Huawei Nova Y70 supports taking scrolling screenshots using a knuckle gesture, which allows users to capture long-scrolling content such as articles, chat logs, or web pages in a single image. To perform this gesture, the user must first ensure that the \"Smart screenshot\" feature is enabled in Settings > Accessibility features > Motion control > Take screenshot. Once enabled, the user can initiate a scrolling screenshot by knocking once on the screen with a single knuckle and then drawing an “S” shape with the knuckle while keeping contact with the screen. The device will automatically scroll down the page and capture the entire content until the user lifts their knuckle or manually taps the screen to stop.\n\nThe visual context provided includes an image (referenced in the knowledge base) showing a partial screenshot interface with a drawn outline over a long vertical scrollable page — likely an article or chat log — which confirms the device’s ability to capture extended content. While no specific image directly shows a scrolling screenshot of buildings, the gesture mechanics are consistent across all scrollable content types, including web pages displaying images of buildings. The knuckle-drawn “S” gesture is designed to be intuitive and works regardless of the content type, whether it is text, images, or a combination such as a webpage featuring architectural photos or landscape views.\n\nTherefore, a demonstration of a knuckle-based scrolling screenshot on a screen displaying buildings would follow the same procedure: initiate the gesture by drawing an “S” with the knuckle on the screen where the building image or webpage is visible, and the device will scroll and capture the full length of the content, including all visible buildings, in one continuous image.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
      "summary": "The demonstration of using a knuckle gesture to take a scrolling screenshot does not specifically show any buildings in the first picture. While the gesture works on any scrollable content, including web pages that may display buildings, the provided material does not describe or show an image of buildings in the initial screenshot. The focus is on the gesture mechanics, not the content being captured.",

      "raw_result": "The provided context does not contain any image or description of a first picture depicting buildings in relation to a knuckle gesture scrolling screenshot. While multiple references detail how to perform a scrolling screenshot using a knuckle gesture — specifically, knocking on the screen with a knuckle and drawing an \"S\" shape — none of the document chunks describe an image showing buildings or any specific visual content captured during such a gesture. The visual analyses in the context focus on UI elements like screenshot editing panels, settings menus, or split-screen interfaces, but not on the content of screenshots themselves, such as buildings or landscapes.\n\nTherefore, there is no evidence in the provided context to confirm that a first picture of buildings was depicted during a knuckle gesture scrolling screenshot.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
