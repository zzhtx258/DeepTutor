      "raw_result": "In the Pro Mode of the Huawei Nova Y70 camera system, the icon located on the right-hand side of the icon that selects a focus mode serves a critical function related to adjusting the camera's metering mode. This icon allows users to change the way the camera measures light for exposure, which directly influences the quality of photographs taken in various lighting conditions.\n\nThe metering mode options available typically include:\n\n- **Matrix Metering**: Measures light across the entire frame, suitable for capturing natural landscapes with even lighting.\n- **Center Metering**: Focuses on the light in the center of the frame, ideal for portrait photography.\n- **Spot Metering**: Measures light from a specific small area, such as a subject's eyes, allowing for precise exposure control in high-contrast scenes.\n\nAdjusting the metering mode can significantly enhance image exposure accuracy based on the shooting scenario, thereby supporting the overall goal of achieving professional-quality images through granular control of camera settings in Pro Mode [1]. \n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The **focus mode selector** in the Pro Mode of the Huawei Nova Y70 provides users with three different focus modes, each designed for specific photographic scenarios:\n\n1. **AF-S (Single Autofocus)**:\n   - Best suited for **stationary subjects**. When this mode is selected, the camera locks focus on the subject when the shutter button is pressed, which is ideal for portraits or still scenes.\n\n2. **AF-C (Continuous Autofocus)**:\n   - Designed for **moving subjects**. This mode allows the camera to continuously adjust focus as the subject moves, making it useful for action photography where tracking fast movements is necessary.\n\n3. **MF (Manual Focus)**:\n   - In this mode, users manually control the focus by touching the part of the screen that they want to focus on. This is particularly useful in situations where precise focus on a specific element, such as a subject's eyes, is required.\n\nThe functionality of the focus mode selector supports the broader aim of Pro Mode, which is to give photographers granular control over camera parameters to enhance their photography experience, enabling more professional-quality photos tailored to different shooting conditions. \n\nThese focus modes reflect the context's instruction to touch the screen to adjust focus, reinforcing the flexibility user requires when selecting settings for various photography challenges. \n\n### References\n\n- [1] nova_y70.pdf",
