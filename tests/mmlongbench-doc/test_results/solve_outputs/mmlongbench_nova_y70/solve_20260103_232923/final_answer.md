## S1: Function of the Icon on the Right-Hand Side of the Focus Mode Selector in Pro Mode

In the Pro Mode of the Huawei Nova Y70 camera, the icon located on the right-hand side of the focus mode selector plays a crucial role in enhancing the user's photographic capabilities. This icon allows users to select between different focus modes, which are essential for adapting to various shooting conditions.

The available focus modes include:

- **AF-S (Single Focus)**: This mode is designed for capturing stationary subjects. It locks the focus on the subject when the shutter button is pressed halfway, making it ideal for still photography.
  
- **AF-C (Continuous Focus)**: This mode is suited for moving subjects. It continuously adjusts the focus as the subject moves, ensuring that the subject remains sharp and clear throughout the shot.

- **MF (Manual Focus)**: This mode provides users with full control over the focus settings, allowing them to manually adjust the focus to achieve the desired effect. This is particularly useful in situations where automatic focus may struggle, such as in low light or with complex scenes.

By utilizing this focus mode selector, photographers can achieve greater flexibility and precision in their shots, tailoring their approach based on the dynamics of the subject being photographed. This functionality is essential for both amateur and professional photographers looking to enhance their image quality in diverse environments.

## S2: Summary of Focus Modes in Pro Mode

In the Pro Mode of the Huawei Nova Y70 camera, users have access to three distinct focus modes, each tailored for specific photographic scenarios. Understanding these modes is essential for maximizing the camera's potential and achieving high-quality images.

1. **AF-S (Single Autofocus)**:
   - This mode is optimized for capturing **stationary subjects**. When selected, the camera locks the focus on the subject once the shutter button is pressed halfway. This ensures that the subject remains sharp, making it ideal for portraits or still life photography.

2. **AF-C (Continuous Autofocus)**:
   - Designed for **moving subjects**, this mode continuously adjusts the focus as the subject moves within the frame. This capability is particularly beneficial for action shots, such as sports photography or wildlife photography, where maintaining focus on a moving target is crucial.

3. **MF (Manual Focus)**:
   - In this mode, users have complete control over the focus settings, allowing them to manually adjust the focus to their preference. This is especially useful in complex scenes or low-light conditions where automatic focus may struggle. Photographers can achieve a desired artistic effect or ensure that a specific part of the scene is in focus.

By utilizing these focus modes effectively, photographers can adapt their shooting techniques to various environments and subjects, enhancing their overall photographic experience. The ability to select the appropriate focus mode contributes significantly to achieving professional-quality photos, catering to both amateur and experienced photographers alike.
