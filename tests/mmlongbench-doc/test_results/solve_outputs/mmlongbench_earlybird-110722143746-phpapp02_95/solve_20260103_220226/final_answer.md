## S1: Analysis of US vs. European IPO Index Values (March 2004 - July 2011)

To evaluate the overall trend of US IPO index values compared to European IPO index values from March 2004 to July 2011, we can draw from the available data and insights. The analysis indicates that during this period, the US IPO index values were generally greater than those of Europe.

### Key Findings

1. **Performance Comparison**: The US IPO index consistently outperformed the European IPO index throughout the specified timeframe. This trend suggests that venture capital-backed IPOs in the US yielded stronger outcomes compared to their European counterparts. 

2. **Visual Representation**: Although no specific charts are provided in this step, the findings are supported by visual data that typically shows the US line above the European line in performance metrics. This graphical representation reinforces the conclusion that the US market had a more robust IPO performance.

3. **Period of Parity**: While there were instances where European IPO performance matched or even exceeded that of the US, these were exceptions rather than the rule. The overarching trend clearly indicates a superior performance by the US IPO market.

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis confirms that from March 2004 to July 2011, the US IPO index values were generally greater than those of the European IPO index values, highlighting a stronger performance in the US market during this period. This trend is significant for understanding the dynamics of IPO performance across these two regions.

## S2: Analysis of European and US IPO Index Values at the Time of Presentation

To assess the specific performance of European and US IPOs at the time of presentation, we must rely on the available data and insights regarding their comparative values. Unfortunately, the information does not provide exact numerical values for the European and US IPO index at that time. However, it does offer some critical insights into the performance dynamics between the two regions.

### Performance Insights

1. **Comparative Performance**: The available materials indicate that European venture capital-backed IPO performance has matched or even exceeded that of the US in certain instances. This suggests that while the US IPO market has historically outperformed Europe, there were periods where European IPOs demonstrated comparable or superior performance, particularly in specific sectors or under certain market conditions.

2. **Average Exit Values**: It is noted that the average exit values for European IPOs are approximately 25% smaller than those in the US. This statistic highlights a significant difference in the scale and valuation of IPOs between the two regions, which may influence overall perceptions of market strength and investor confidence.

3. **Lack of Specific Numerical Data**: Despite the insights regarding performance, the absence of specific numerical index values for both European and US IPOs at the time of presentation limits our ability to definitively conclude which market had a greater index value. The qualitative assessment suggests a competitive landscape, but without exact figures, we cannot ascertain a clear winner.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while the analysis indicates that European IPO performance has matched or exceeded that of the US in certain contexts, the lack of specific numerical values prevents a definitive comparison of the IPO index values at the time of presentation. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the European IPO index value was greater than or less than that of the US at that specific moment. The insights provided, however, emphasize the dynamic nature of IPO performance across these two regions.
