      "raw_result": "The comparison of the post-initial public offering (IPO) performance between venture capital-backed companies in the United States and Europe is visually represented in a bar chart titled \"US vs. Europe, post-IPO performance of all VC-backed IPOs*, 03/04 to 07/11.\" This chart indicates that the performance of US VC-backed IPOs has generally been stronger compared to their European counterparts over the time period examined, which spans from March 2004 to July 2011.\n\nKey insights from the chart include:\n\n- The US line (in blue) typically remains above the European line (in orange) across most quarterly intervals, suggesting superior post-IPO stock performance.\n- Both regions experienced notable peaks around 2007Q2–2008Q1, which align with pre-financial crisis market highs, followed by sharp declines through 2009.\n- The European line displays slightly greater volatility, with more pronounced dips and recoveries than the US line.\n\nOverall, while there are specific time frames where European performance may match or exceed US performance, the data largely shows that US IPOs have historically had stronger outcomes following their public offerings.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",

The US line typically remains above the European line in performance charts, suggesting stronger outcomes for US VC-backed IPOs. Although there were periods where European performance matched or exceeded that of the US, the overall trend shows the US outperforming Europe.",
