      "raw_result": "The comparison of the post-initial public offering (IPO) performance between venture capital-backed companies in the United States and Europe is visually represented in a bar chart titled \"US vs. Europe, post-IPO performance of all VC-backed IPOs*, 03/04 to 07/11.\" This chart indicates that the performance of US VC-backed IPOs has generally been stronger compared to their European counterparts over the time period examined, which spans from March 2004 to July 2011.\n\nKey insights from the chart include:\n\n- The US line (in blue) typically remains above the European line (in orange) across most quarterly intervals, suggesting superior post-IPO stock performance.\n- Both regions experienced notable peaks around 2007Q2–2008Q1, which align with pre-financial crisis market highs, followed by sharp declines through 2009.\n- The European line displays slightly greater volatility, with more pronounced dips and recoveries than the US line.\n\nOverall, while there are specific time frames where European performance may match or exceed US performance, the data largely shows that US IPOs have historically had stronger outcomes following their public offerings.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
      "summary": "The comparison of post-IPO performance indicates that the US IPO index value has generally been greater than the European IPO index value from March 2004 to July 2011. The US line typically remains above the European line in performance charts, suggesting stronger outcomes for US VC-backed IPOs. Although there were periods where European performance matched or exceeded that of the US, the overall trend shows the US outperforming Europe.",

However, it mentions that European venture capital-backed IPO performance matches or exceeds US performance, implying a comparative evaluation of their performance over time. Additionally, a visual representation in the context suggests that while average exit values in Europe are approximately 25% smaller than those in the US, Europe has matched the US in exit valuations despite investing significantly less capital.\n\nIn terms of specific numerical values or direct index comparisons at the time of presentation, unfortunately, there is not enough information available in the context to provide those details.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
