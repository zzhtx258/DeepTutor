      "step_response": "## S1: Assessing Data Sufficiency for a Shared Average Exit Cap Value\n\nTo determine whether the US, Europe, and China share a common average exit cap value — as implied by the chart referenced in the query — we must first evaluate whether the available knowledge base provides sufficient data to support such a conclusion. The average exit cap is defined as the median or mean enterprise valuation at which venture-backed companies exit (e.g., via IPO or acquisition), typically reported in USD millions for companies exceeding a minimum exit threshold [rag-1].\n\nThe available materials consistently indicate that data on average exit caps is available for the United States and Europe. Specifically, one source notes that for companies with exits above $100 million, the average exit cap is approximately $350 million in both the US and Europe [rag-1]. However, **no data whatsoever is provided for China** across all three knowledge base citations [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3]. Each citation explicitly states that China’s average exit cap is absent from the dataset, with one even emphasizing that “all referenced data pertains exclusively to... the United States and Europe” [rag-3].\n\nFurthermore, the tool execution results confirm this gap: “The available data does not provide information about China's average exit cap, so it cannot be confirmed whether the US, Europe, and China share the same average exit cap value” [none]. Without China’s value, it is mathematically and logically impossible to identify a shared point of equality among all three regions, even if the US and Europe align at $350 million.\n\nSince the question hinges on identifying a *shared* value across all three geographies, and one of the three (China) is entirely unrepresented in the data, the necessary condition for answering the question — a complete and comparable dataset — is not met.\n\n### Summary\nThe available knowledge base and tool outputs do not contain any information regarding China’s average exit cap. While US and Europe may share a value of $350 million, the absence of China’s data renders it impossible to confirm or identify a common value across all three regions. Therefore, the requested integer value cannot be determined from the given materials.",
