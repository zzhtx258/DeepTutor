This indicates that, despite differing levels of capital investment, Europe has matched the U.S. in exit valuations.\n\nHowever, there is no mention of China in any of the document chunks, nor are there any charts, figures, or textual references comparing exit values in China to those in the U.S. or Europe. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether China’s average exit cap is the same, higher, or lower than that of the U.S. and Europe based on the provided information.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
