## S1: Assessing Data Sufficiency for a Shared Average Exit Cap Value

To determine whether the US, Europe, and China share a common average exit cap value — as implied by the chart referenced in the query — we must first evaluate whether the available knowledge base provides sufficient data to support such a conclusion. The average exit cap is defined as the median or mean enterprise valuation at which venture-backed companies exit (e.g., via IPO or acquisition), typically reported in USD millions for companies exceeding a minimum exit threshold [rag-1].

The available materials consistently indicate that data on average exit caps is available for the United States and Europe. Specifically, one source notes that for companies with exits above $100 million, the average exit cap is approximately $350 million in both the US and Europe [rag-1]. However, **no data whatsoever is provided for China** across all three knowledge base citations [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3]. Each citation explicitly states that China’s average exit cap is absent from the dataset, with one even emphasizing that “all referenced data pertains exclusively to... the United States and Europe” [rag-3].

Furthermore, the tool execution results confirm this gap: “The available data does not provide information about China's average exit cap, so it cannot be confirmed whether the US, Europe, and China share the same average exit cap value” [none]. Without China’s value, it is mathematically and logically impossible to identify a shared point of equality among all three regions, even if the US and Europe align at $350 million.

Since the question hinges on identifying a *shared* value across all three geographies, and one of the three (China) is entirely unrepresented in the data, the necessary condition for answering the question — a complete and comparable dataset — is not met.

### Summary
The available knowledge base and tool outputs do not contain any information regarding China’s average exit cap. While US and Europe may share a value of $350 million, the absence of China’s data renders it impossible to confirm or identify a common value across all three regions. Therefore, the requested integer value cannot be determined from the given materials.

    The available data shows that the average exit cap for companies with exits above $100 million is approximately $350 million in both the United States and Europe, but there is no information provided about China's average exit cap, so it cannot be confirmed whether all three regions share the same value.
