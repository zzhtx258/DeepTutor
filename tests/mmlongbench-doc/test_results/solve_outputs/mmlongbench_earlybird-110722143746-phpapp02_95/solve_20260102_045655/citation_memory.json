The available data focuses primarily on comparisons between Germany and other G7 nations (such as Japan, the United States, Canada, and Italy) regarding GDP per capita growth, export volume, R&D investment, patent filings, and venture-backed exits. Additionally, there are comparisons between Europe and the United States on venture capital performance metrics, but no direct visual or quantitative comparison involving China and Japan.\n\nWhile China is mentioned in the context — notably as an emerging economy whose growth Germany has leveraged through exports of high-quality specialized products — it is not presented alongside Japan in any chart, graph, or comparative data visualization. The only reference to Japan is its GDP per capita growth rate of 0.9%, which is shown in an infographic comparing G7 nations, with Germany at 2.1%. China is not included in that bar chart or any other visual representation within the provided documents.\n\nTherefore, based on the available context, there is no chart or graph that compares China and Japan using economic, demographic, or technological indicators.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
