## S1: Determining the Presence of a China-Japan Comparative Chart

The objective of this step is to determine whether any chart or graph in the provided knowledge base explicitly compares China and Japan. Based on a comprehensive review of all retrieved context and tool execution results, there is no evidence of any visual or quantitative comparison between China and Japan in the provided materials.

Multiple independent queries were conducted to verify this absence:  
- Querying for “chart comparing China and Japan” returned no results, with all retrieved documents focusing exclusively on venture capital ecosystems in the United States and Europe [rag-1][rag-2].  
- A more expansive query for comparisons across economic, demographic, or technological indicators also confirmed the absence of any China-Japan comparison; while Japan appears in a G7 GDP per capita growth context, China is entirely omitted from all visual and numerical analyses [rag-3].  

The raw excerpts consistently reinforce this conclusion: “All retrieved context focuses exclusively on comparisons between the United States and European countries, with no mention or inclusion of China or Japan in any visual or quantitative analysis” [rag-1][rag-2][rag-3]. No charts, graphs, tables, or data visualizations involving both nations are present in the dataset.

Furthermore, no image artifacts or tool-generated outputs were produced that could supplement or contradict this finding. The absence of any multimodal evidence further confirms that no such comparative chart exists within the provided knowledge base.

In summary, based on the explicit and consistent findings across all sources, there is no chart or graph in the slides or supporting materials that compares China and Japan. Any such comparison would require external data not contained in the current context.
