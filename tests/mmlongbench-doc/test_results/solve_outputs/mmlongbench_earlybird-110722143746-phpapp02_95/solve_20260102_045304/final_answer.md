## S1: Analysis of Median Exit Valuations in the USA and Europe

The median exit valuation for venture capital-backed companies in both the United States and Europe is approximately $350 million, according to the available evidence [rag-1]. This figure represents the midpoint of exit values for companies that achieved exits above $100 million, and it is explicitly stated that this median value is nearly identical across both regions [rag-1]. Although the United States has a higher total number of large-scale exits, the central tendency — as measured by the median — does not differ meaningfully between the two geographies [rag-1]. The consistency in median valuation suggests that, at the time of the presentation, the typical successful exit in the U.S. was not financially distinct from its European counterpart in terms of scale.

This equivalence implies that, contrary to assumptions about market dominance by the U.S., the median outcome for venture-backed exits is remarkably aligned between the two regions. No quantitative difference exists that would support a claim of one region outperforming the other in median exit value.

### Summary
The median exit valuation for venture capital-backed companies in both the USA and Europe is $350 million, indicating no significant difference between the two regions at the time of the presentation.

## S2: Calculation of the Difference in Median Exit Valuations

To determine how many more millions of dollars the median exit valuation in the USA was compared to Europe, we compute the absolute difference between the two values. As established in the previous step, the median exit valuation for venture capital-backed companies in both the United States and Europe is approximately $350 million [rag-1]. This equivalence is not an approximation error or rounding artifact—it is explicitly stated as a near-identical central tendency across both regions, even when controlling for exits above $100 million [rag-1].

The difference is therefore calculated as:

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{USA Median} - \text{Europe Median} = 350 - 350 = 0 \text{ million dollars}
$$

This result confirms that, at the time of the presentation, there was no financial disparity in the median exit valuation between the two regions. The U.S. may have had a higher volume of large exits, but the typical (median) exit value was statistically and numerically the same as in Europe [rag-1].

### Summary
The median exit valuation in the USA and Europe is identical at $350 million, resulting in a difference of $0 million. Thus, the USA did not have a higher median exit valuation than Europe.

    The median exit valuation for venture capital-backed companies in the United States and Europe was approximately $350 million, showing no significant difference between the two regions for exits above $100 million. Despite the U.S. having more large exits, the median value of those high-value exits was nearly identical in both regions.
