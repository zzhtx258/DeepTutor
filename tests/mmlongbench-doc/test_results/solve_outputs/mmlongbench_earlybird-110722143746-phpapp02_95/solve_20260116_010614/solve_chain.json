These charts are specifically designed to facilitate direct comparative analysis between the two major economic and venture capital regions.\n\nThe 9 charts cover a range of metrics, including:\n- VC fund data coverage\n- Performance metrics from 2004–2010\n- Mid-stage deals\n- Quartile performance distribution\n- Post-IPO performance\n- Proportional exit shares since 2004\n- Early-stage entry valuations (2004–2009)\n- VC team maturity by fund generations\n\nAll these visualizations use consistent color-coding — red for the US and blue for Europe — to ensure clarity and immediate recognition of regional comparisons [rag-1].\n\nThis count is explicitly confirmed by both the textual summary and the raw numerical result returned by the tool execution, which independently verified the value “9” [rag-1][tool-1].\n\n### Summary\nIn total, 9 distinct charts in the slides are dedicated exclusively to comparing the US and Europe, making them ideal for focused cross-regional analysis without confounding variables from other geographies.",
