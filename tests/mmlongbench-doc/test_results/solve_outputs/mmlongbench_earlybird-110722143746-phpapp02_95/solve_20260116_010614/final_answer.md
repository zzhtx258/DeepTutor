## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification and Count of Charts Comparing ONLY the US and Europe

Based on the provided materials, there are exactly **9 charts** in the slides that compare **ONLY the United States and Europe**, with no inclusion of other regions such as China or individual European sub-regions (unless aggregated into “Europe”) [rag-1]. These charts are specifically designed to facilitate direct comparative analysis between the two major economic and venture capital regions.

The 9 charts cover a range of metrics, including:
- VC fund data coverage
- Performance metrics from 2004–2010
- Mid-stage deals
- Quartile performance distribution
- Post-IPO performance
- Proportional exit shares since 2004
- Early-stage entry valuations (2004–2009)
- VC team maturity by fund generations

All these visualizations use consistent color-coding — red for the US and blue for Europe — to ensure clarity and immediate recognition of regional comparisons [rag-1].

This count is explicitly confirmed by both the textual summary and the raw numerical result returned by the tool execution, which independently verified the value “9” [rag-1][tool-1].

### Summary
In total, 9 distinct charts in the slides are dedicated exclusively to comparing the US and Europe, making them ideal for focused cross-regional analysis without confounding variables from other geographies.
