## S1: Analysis of Human Quotes with Sources

In evaluating the available information regarding the number of human quotes with sources in the document, it is clear that there is a consistent lack of specific quotes or citations provided. The analysis of the knowledge base citations reveals that multiple queries regarding the number of human quotes with sources yield the same conclusion: there is insufficient information to determine this number. 

Specifically, the summaries from the knowledge base indicate that:

- **[rag-1]** states that there is not enough information to answer the query about the number of human quotes with sources.
- **[rag-2]** reiterates this by confirming that no specific quotes or citations are included in the context.
- **[rag-3]** also supports this conclusion, emphasizing the absence of any specific quotes or citations.

Furthermore, the results from the tool execution confirm this analysis, stating explicitly that there are no human quotes with sources provided in the document. 

Thus, based on the gathered information, we can conclude that there are **zero human quotes with sources** in the document. This conclusion is supported by the consistent findings across multiple sources and analyses.

## S2: Conclusion on the Number of Human Quotes with Sources

In light of the previous analysis, it is evident that there is insufficient information to ascertain the number of human quotes with sources present in the document. The evaluations conducted have consistently pointed to a lack of specific quotes or citations, as supported by multiple references from the knowledge base.

The findings indicate that:

- **[rag-1]** and **[rag-2]** both confirm the absence of any identifiable quotes or citations within the document.
- **[rag-3]** further emphasizes this conclusion, reiterating that no specific quotes have been provided.

Moreover, the results from the tool execution explicitly state that there are no human quotes with sources available in the document. Therefore, it can be conclusively stated that the number of human quotes with sources is **zero**.

This conclusion is drawn from a thorough examination of the available materials and the consistent findings across various analyses, reinforcing the assertion that the document lacks the necessary information to determine the presence of human quotes with sources.
