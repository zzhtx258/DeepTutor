Furthermore, **no source confirms a single data point — either by year or otherwise — where the average exit cap values for all three regions are numerically identical** [rag-1, rag-3, rag-4].\n\nEven if we attempt to infer intersection points from approximate ranges (e.g., US: `$250$`–`$370$`M, Europe: `$304$`M, China: `$420$`M in 2010), the values do not align. For instance, `$304$` million (Europe’s average) does not match `$370$` million (US in 2010) or `$420$` million (China in 2010). No overlapping integer value is reported or derivable from the given data.\n\nTherefore, based on the absence of exact numerical data and the lack of any confirmed convergence point among the three regions, we conclude that **there is no identifiable point in the available data where US, Europe, and China have the same average exit cap value**.\n\n### Summary\nNo point exists in the available data where the average exit capitalization values for the United States, Europe, and China are identical. The chart and supporting materials provide only approximate ranges and trends without confirming any exact convergence point. Thus, the requested integer value cannot be determined from the given information.",
