      "step_response": "## S1: Identification of Pages Containing Charts with Calendar Years on Horizontal Axis\n\nTo address the question of how many pages include charts whose horizontal axis is set as calendar years (e.g., 2004–2010), we analyze the available document references and synthesized results from multiple retrieval queries.\n\nBased on the retrieved knowledge base citations, specifically `[rag-2]` and `[rag-3]`, we can confirm that **three distinct pages** — **Page 23**, **Page 24**, and **Page 25** — contain charts explicitly using calendar years on their horizontal axes:\n\n- **Page 23**: Features the *“Number of Midstage VC Deals Chart”*, which spans the period **2004 to 2010**. This chart compares U.S. and European mid-stage venture capital deals over time, with years clearly marked along the x-axis `[rag-3]`.\n  \n- **Page 24**: Contains a *“3D Area Chart”* that visualizes valuation trends from **2004 to 2009**, again using calendar years as the horizontal axis `[rag-3]`.\n\n- **Page 25**: Includes a *“Line Chart”* tracking European investments across the period **2004 to 2009**, confirming the use of calendar years on the horizontal axis `[rag-3]`.\n\nWhile earlier references (e.g., in `[rag-2]`) mention additional pages such as Page 3 and Page 5 as potentially containing time-series charts spanning similar years, these are not confirmed with specific chart titles or axis details. Therefore, for precision and evidence-based reporting, we restrict our count to only those pages where both the presence of a chart and its use of calendar years on the horizontal axis are explicitly verified.\n\n### Summary\nThree pages — **23, 24, and 25** — are definitively documented as containing charts with calendar years (e.g., 2004–2010) on the horizontal axis. No further pages can be confidently included without additional specific evidence.",
