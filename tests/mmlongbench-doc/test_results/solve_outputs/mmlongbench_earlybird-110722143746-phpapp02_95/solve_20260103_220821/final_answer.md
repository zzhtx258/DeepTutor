## S1: Analysis of Newspaper Opinions on Spain's Venture Capital

In evaluating the current state of information regarding newspaper opinions on Spain's venture capital, it is essential to note that there is a significant lack of available data on this topic. Multiple queries into the opinions expressed by newspapers concerning the venture capital landscape in Spain have yielded consistent results indicating insufficient information. Specifically, the sources reviewed have not identified any particular newspapers whose opinions are selected to illustrate the situation of Spain's venture capital.

This absence of information suggests that there may be limited coverage or analysis from mainstream media regarding the dynamics of venture capital in Spain. It could also imply that the topic has not been a focal point in recent discussions within the media landscape, or that the opinions that do exist have not been consolidated or highlighted in a way that allows for clear identification of specific sources.

In summary, the current analysis reveals a gap in the availability of newspaper opinions on Spain's venture capital, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive overview of the media's perspective on this subject. Further research or data collection may be necessary to gain insights into how newspapers are addressing the venture capital scene in Spain.
