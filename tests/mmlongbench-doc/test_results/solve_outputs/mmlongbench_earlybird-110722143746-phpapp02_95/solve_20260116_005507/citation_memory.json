While Europe’s exit valuations are lower than those of the USA, they are achieved with significantly less capital invested — $44 million in Europe versus $79 million in the USA — highlighting Europe’s greater capital efficiency.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Average Exit Valuation\n- [2] European vs US VC Performance Metrics Bar Chart 2004-2010 (image)\n- [3] Average Capital Invested Prior to Exit\n- [4] Capital Efficiency\n- [5] USA",
