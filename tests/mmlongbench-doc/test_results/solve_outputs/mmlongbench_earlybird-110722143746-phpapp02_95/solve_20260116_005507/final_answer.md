## S1: Calculation of the Difference in Median Exit Valuations Between USA and Europe

To determine how many more millions of dollars the median exit valuation in the USA was compared to Europe, we extract the exact values from the provided materials:

- The median exit valuation in the **USA** is `$388$` million dollars `[rag-1]`.
- The median exit valuation in **Europe** is `$304$` million dollars `[rag-1]`.

The difference is computed as follows:

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{USA Median} - \text{Europe Median} = 388 - 304 = 84
$$

Thus, the median exit valuation in the USA was `$84$` million dollars higher than in Europe during the 2004–2010 period `[rag-1]`.

This result is also directly confirmed by the tool execution summary, which states: “The median exit valuation in the USA was $84 million higher than in Europe.” `[none]`

### Summary
The USA’s median exit valuation exceeded Europe’s by exactly `$84$` million dollars, based on data from the 2004–2010 period. This highlights a significant valuation gap between the two regions despite Europe achieving comparable outcomes with less capital invested.
