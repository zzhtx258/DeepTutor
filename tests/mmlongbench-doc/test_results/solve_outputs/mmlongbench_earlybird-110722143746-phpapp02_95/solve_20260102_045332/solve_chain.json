      "step_response": "## S1: Determining Availability of Numerical IPO Index Values at Time of Presentation\n\nTo address the question of whether the Europe IPO index value or the US IPO index value was greater at the time of the presentation (circa July 2011), we must first establish whether the available materials provide explicit numerical values for either index at that specific point in time. According to the knowledge base, the available data includes comparative visualizations of post-IPO performance, capital efficiency, and venture capital outcomes between the U.S. and Europe, but none of these sources report the actual index values for either region as of July 2011 [rag-1]. The summary explicitly states: “The available data does not provide exact IPO index values for Europe or the United States at the time of the presentation” [rag-1]. Furthermore, no tool execution or external data retrieval yielded any quantitative figures for the Europe IPO index or the US IPO index on or near the presentation date. The absence of such data is corroborated by the raw excerpt, which reiterates that “no explicit numerical index values are given for the endpoint date” [rag-1].\n\nSince the determination of which index was greater requires a direct numerical comparison, and no such values are present in the provided materials, it is not possible to conclude which region’s IPO index was higher at that time. Any inference based on relative performance trends (e.g., U.S. outperforming Europe over time) would be speculative without the baseline value at the endpoint [rag-1].\n\nIn summary, the available evidence is insufficient to determine whether the Europe IPO index or the US IPO index was greater at the time of the presentation, as neither value is numerically specified in the provided materials.",
