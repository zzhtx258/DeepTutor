      "raw_result": "The provided context does not contain direct data on the IPO index values for Europe versus the United States at the time of presentation. While several visualizations compare post-IPO performance, exit values, capital efficiency, and venture capital metrics between the two regions, none explicitly present a standardized IPO index (such as a weighted average of IPO stock performance over time) for direct comparison at the time the report was compiled (circa July 2011).\n\nOne chart titled “US vs. Europe, post-IPO performance of all VC-backed IPOs*, 03/04 to 07/11” (reference_id: 1) shows line graphs of stock performance trends for VC-backed IPOs in both regions from March 2004 to July 2011. It indicates that the U.S. line generally outperformed the European line across most time points, with both peaking around 2007Q2–2008Q1 and declining sharply through 2009. However, the chart does not provide numerical index values (e.g., S&P 500 or Euro Stoxx 50 equivalents) or a single comparative index value at the endpoint (July 2011).\n\nAdditionally, while the report asserts that “European VC-backed IPO performance matches or exceeds US performance, both pre as well as post-IPO,” this claim is contextual and not quantified by a specific index value at the time of presentation.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the exact IPO index values for Europe and the U.S. at the time of presentation cannot be determined.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
      "summary": "The available data does not provide exact IPO index values for Europe or the United States at the time of the presentation (circa July 2011). While a chart comparing post-IPO performance of VC-backed IPOs in both regions shows the U.S. generally outperforming Europe over time, no specific numerical index values are given for the endpoint date. The report's claim that European performance matches or exceeds U.S. performance is not supported by quantified index data at the time of presentation.",
