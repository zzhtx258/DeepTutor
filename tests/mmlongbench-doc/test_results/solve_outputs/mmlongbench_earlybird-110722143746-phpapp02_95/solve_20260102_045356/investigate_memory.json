      "raw_result": "Several charts in the provided context have their horizontal axis labeled with years, representing temporal trends in venture capital activity across Europe and the United States. These include:\n\n- A vertical bar chart titled **\"Earlybird Dealflow Year on Year (No. of New Leads)*\"**, which displays six bars corresponding to the years 2017 through 2022. The increasing height of the bars illustrates a steady growth in the number of new startup leads captured by Earlybird over this period.\n\n- Another chart, **\"European VC Fund Performance by Vintage Year\"**, uses vintage years from 1998 to 2010 along the horizontal axis to show internal rate of return (IRR) trends. The bars for 1998–2002 are muted gray, while those for 2005 and 2007 are highlighted in blue, indicating a performance inflection point post-2004.\n\n- The chart titled **\"Early-Stage VC Fundraising Europe*\"** (from 1999 to 2005) plots annual fundraising totals with years on the x-axis, showing a peak during the dot-com bubble years of 1999 and 2000, followed by a sharp decline through 2004.\n\n- A comparative chart titled **\"US vs. European Share in VC Value Contribution, since 2004\"** uses time periods (likely biennial or annual) from 2004 to approximately 2020 along the horizontal axis to depict the evolving share of VC value contribution between the U.S. and Europe.\n\n- The chart **\"US vs. Europe, post-IPO performance of all VC-backed IPOs*, 03/04 to 07/11\"** presents quarterly time intervals (e.g., 2004Q2, 2005Q1, ..., 2011Q2) on the x-axis to track stock performance trends of venture-backed IPOs over time.\n\n- A chart titled **\"Median Pre-Money Valuation - Initial Round in €M\"** spans fund generation years from 2005 to 2009 on the horizontal axis, showing a clear upward trend in startup valuations in Germany over this period.\n\nThese charts collectively use year-based horizontal axes to highlight temporal dynamics in VC dealflow, fundraising, performance, and valuation trends across different phases of the venture capital cycle.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
      "summary": "Multiple charts in the document use year-based horizontal axes to depict temporal trends in venture capital activity, including dealflow, fundraising, performance, and valuation data from years such as 1998 to 2022. Specific examples include charts tracking Earlybird dealflow (2017–2022), European VC fund performance by vintage year (1998–2010), US vs. European VC value contribution since 2004, and median pre-money valuations in Germany (2005–2009). These charts directly answer the query about charts with horizontal axes set as years.",

To determine the total number of such charts, we analyze each document chunk for visual descriptions indicating a time-based x-axis labeled with years (e.g., 2017–2022, 1999–2005, etc.).\n\nThe following charts from the context have a horizontal axis explicitly representing years:\n\n1. **\"Earlybird Dealflow Year on Year (No. of New Leads)*\"** – x-axis shows years from 2017 to 2022.  \n2. **\"Early-Stage VC Fundraising Europe*\"** – x-axis lists years from 1999 to 2004.  \n3. **\"European VC Fund Performance by Vintage Year\"** – x-axis represents vintage years from 1998 to 2010 in even-year increments.  \n4. **\"US vs. European Share in VC Value Contribution, since 2004\"** – x-axis represents time periods from 2004 to approximately 2020 (implied biennial or annual intervals).  \n\nThe remaining charts in the context use categorical or stage-based x-axes (e.g., countries, funding stages, sectors, fund generations), not year-based timelines.\n\nThus, there are **4 charts** with a horizontal axis set as years.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
