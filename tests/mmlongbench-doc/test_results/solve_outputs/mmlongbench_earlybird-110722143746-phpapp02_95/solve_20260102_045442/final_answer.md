## S1: Identification and Count of Attributed Human Quotes

To determine the number of human quotes explicitly attributed to a source in the document, we analyze the provided materials for direct citations of spoken or written statements linked to identifiable individuals. A human quote with a source is defined as a verbatim statement made by a person, accompanied by clear attribution to their name and, ideally, their institutional affiliation or role, as per standard academic and journalistic citation practices [rag-1].

The available materials consistently report a single instance of such a quote:  
> "Germany is in a very competitive position today, more than ever" — attributed to Stephane Garelli, Director of the World Competitiveness Center at IMD [rag-1].

This quote is embedded within the visual narrative of the infographic titled *“Germany: The China of Europe”*, where it serves to substantiate claims regarding Germany’s global economic competitiveness. The attribution is explicit—both the speaker’s full name and professional title are provided—meeting the criterion for a properly sourced human quote.

No other quotes in the document are identified in the knowledge base or tool results as being attributed to a specific individual. The absence of additional citations, combined with the uniformity of the evidence across both the knowledge base summary and the tool execution result, confirms that only one such quote exists.

Thus, the total count of human quotes in the document that are explicitly attributed to a source is **one**.

### Summary  
The document contains exactly one human quote with a clearly cited source: the statement by Stephane Garelli. All available evidence converges on this conclusion, with no conflicting or additional instances found.
