      "raw_result": "Several charts in the provided context directly compare venture capital (VC) performance, investment, and exit metrics between the United States and Europe, designed for clear visual presentation in slides. These charts follow a minimalist, data-driven style typical of financial and investment reports, using consistent color coding (blue for Europe, orange or gray for the U.S.) to enhance comparability.\n\nOne key chart titled **“Median Multiple of Cash Invested vs. Exits over $100M: Europe vs. USA”** visually contrasts two critical performance indicators. It shows that European VC funds achieve a significantly higher median multiple of cash invested (7.2x) compared to the U.S. (4.5x), while the number of exits over $100M is substantially lower in Europe (131) than in the U.S. (596). This highlights Europe’s superior capital efficiency despite fewer mega-exits. Another similar chart, **“Benchmarking of VC Performance Drivers, Europe vs. USA, 2004–2011 YTD”**, breaks down four performance metrics: average capital invested per company, average exit value per company, hit rate, and capital efficiency. Europe consistently uses less capital per company, achieves similar exit values, has a higher hit rate, and demonstrates significantly higher capital efficiency — reinforcing the narrative that European VC delivers better returns per dollar invested.\n\nAdditionally, the chart titled **“Average Exit Cap ($100M+ Exits) US$M”** reveals that the average exit value for companies achieving exits above $100M is nearly identical between the U.S. and Europe at approximately $350 million. This directly supports claims that Europe matches U.S. exit valuations despite investing only half the capital. Complementing this, the chart **“Average Capital Invested Prior to $100M+ Exit”** shows that European startups require roughly half the capital ($100M) to reach a $100M+ exit compared to U.S. startups ($200M), further underscoring efficiency.\n\nThe comparison of overall VC investment volume is captured in a chart titled **“Venture Capital Investment (USD billions)”**, where the U.S. bar reaches ~$200 billion and Europe only ~$40 billion — illustrating a fivefold disparity in capital supply. Meanwhile, early-stage entry valuations are shown to be substantially lower in Europe than in the U.S., with the U.S. averaging $22–24 million versus Europe’s highest (UK) at $10–12 million, contributing to Europe’s cost advantage.\n\nFinally, a chart on **“US vs. European Share in VC Value Contribution, since 2004”** tracks the evolving percentage share of VC value contribution over time, showing the U.S. maintaining dominance but with Europe showing a steady upward trend — suggesting growing influence despite structural disadvantages.\n\nThese charts are designed for slide decks with clean backgrounds, no gridlines, explicit numerical labels, and intuitive color distinctions to ensure immediate comprehension by investors and stakeholders.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
