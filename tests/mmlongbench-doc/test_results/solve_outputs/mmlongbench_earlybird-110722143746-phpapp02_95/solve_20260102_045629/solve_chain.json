      "step_response": "## S1: Identify Charts Comparing Only US and Europe\n\nTo determine how many charts in the slides explicitly compare venture capital (VC) metrics between **only** the United States and Europe, we rely on the explicit enumeration provided in the knowledge base [rag-1]. The materials clearly list six distinct charts that meet this criterion: each chart is designed to present a direct, side-by-side comparison of VC performance, investment, or exit metrics exclusively between these two regions, excluding any other geographies such as Asia, Canada, or global aggregates.\n\nThe six charts are:\n\n1. **Median Multiple of Cash Invested vs. Exits over $100M** — Compares the return efficiency of capital deployed in exits exceeding $100 million between the U.S. and Europe [rag-1].  \n2. **Benchmarking of VC Performance Drivers (2004–2011)** — Analyzes key performance indicators (e.g., IRR, exit rates) over time, contrasting U.S. and European venture ecosystems [rag-1].  \n3. **Average Exit Cap for $100M+ Exits** — Presents the median enterprise value at exit for large-scale exits, differentiated by region [rag-1].  \n4. **Average Capital Invested Prior to $100M+ Exit** — Measures the cumulative funding required to reach a $100M+ exit, comparing U.S. and European portfolio companies [rag-1].  \n5. **Venture Capital Investment (USD billions)** — Shows total annual VC funding volume in the U.S. versus Europe, normalized in USD [rag-1].  \n6. **US vs. European Share in VC Value Contribution since 2004** — Tracks the relative contribution of each region to total global VC value creation over time [rag-1].\n\nAll six charts use consistent visual encoding — blue for Europe and orange/gray for the United States — reinforcing their comparative intent and ensuring interpretability [rag-1]. Importantly, none of these charts include third regions or aggregated global data as part of the comparison; each is strictly bilateral.\n\nNo additional charts were identified in the tool results or knowledge base that meet the criterion of comparing *only* the U.S. and Europe. Therefore, the total number of such charts is confirmed to be six.\n\n### Summary  \nThere are exactly six charts in the slides that explicitly and exclusively compare venture capital metrics between the United States and Europe, as definitively listed and described in the provided materials [rag-1].",
