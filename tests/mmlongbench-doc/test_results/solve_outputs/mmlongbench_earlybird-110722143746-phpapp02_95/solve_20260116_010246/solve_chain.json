This quote is attributed to **Sven Weber**, President of Silicon Valley Bank Capital, and appears in association with the image titled *\"Man with Outstretched Arms Against Blue Sky - Sven Weber Attribution (image)\"* [rag-1].\n\nNo other human quotes with named attributions are cited or referenced elsewhere in the provided context. The count is derived directly from the summary and raw excerpt of the RAG query result, which explicitly states that only one such instance exists.\n\nThus, the total number of human quotes with source attribution in this document is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$\n\nThis conclusion is based solely on the information retrieved from the knowledge base and does not infer or assume additional quotes beyond what is explicitly stated.",
