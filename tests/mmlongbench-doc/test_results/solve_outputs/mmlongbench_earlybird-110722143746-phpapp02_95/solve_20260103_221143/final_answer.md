### S1: Evaluation of Charts Comparing China and Japan

In evaluating the available knowledge regarding charts that compare China and Japan, it is clear from the gathered data that there is insufficient information to identify any specific chart that provides such a comparison. Multiple sources confirm this lack of available data, stating:

- There is no sufficient information available to identify a chart comparing China and Japan. 
- The queries conducted yielded no results that could pinpoint a relevant chart.

This consistent conclusion across the knowledge base indicates that, at this time, we cannot provide a chart that illustrates a comparison between these two countries.

In summary, the analysis confirms that there are no available charts comparing China and Japan based on the current data and resources.
