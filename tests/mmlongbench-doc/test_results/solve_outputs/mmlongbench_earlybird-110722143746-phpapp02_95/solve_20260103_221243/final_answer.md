## S1: Average Exit Cap Value Analysis

In evaluating the average exit cap value for the US and Europe, it is confirmed that both regions exhibit a consistent average exit cap value of approximately $350 million USD for companies with exits exceeding $100 million USD. This figure is significant as it indicates a common valuation benchmark for successful exits in these markets.

However, it is important to note that there is no available data regarding China's average exit cap value. This lack of information limits our ability to make direct comparisons with the US and Europe.

To summarize, the average exit cap value for the US and Europe is $350 million USD, while data for China remains unavailable.

## S2: Conclusion on Average Exit Cap Value for China

In our analysis of the average exit cap values, we have established that both the US and Europe share a common average exit cap value of approximately $350 million USD for companies with exits exceeding $100 million USD. However, it is crucial to highlight that there is no available data regarding China's average exit cap value. 

This absence of data means that we cannot definitively conclude that the average exit cap value for China aligns with the established figures for the US and Europe. Consequently, while the average exit cap for the US and Europe is confirmed to be $350 million USD, we cannot assert that this value is the same for China due to the lack of pertinent information.

In summary, the common average exit cap value for the US and Europe is $350 million USD, but without data for China, we cannot determine if this value applies to that region as well.
