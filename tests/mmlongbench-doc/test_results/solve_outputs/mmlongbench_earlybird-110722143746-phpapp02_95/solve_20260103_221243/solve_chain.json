This figure is significant as it indicates a common valuation benchmark for successful exits in these markets.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no available data regarding China's average exit cap value. This lack of information limits our ability to make direct comparisons with the US and Europe.\n\nTo summarize, the average exit cap value for the US and Europe is $350 million USD, while data for China remains unavailable.",

However, it is crucial to highlight that there is no available data regarding China's average exit cap value. \n\nThis absence of data means that we cannot definitively conclude that the average exit cap value for China aligns with the established figures for the US and Europe. Consequently, while the average exit cap for the US and Europe is confirmed to be $350 million USD, we cannot assert that this value is the same for China due to the lack of pertinent information.\n\nIn summary, the common average exit cap value for the US and Europe is $350 million USD, but without data for China, we cannot determine if this value applies to that region as well.",
