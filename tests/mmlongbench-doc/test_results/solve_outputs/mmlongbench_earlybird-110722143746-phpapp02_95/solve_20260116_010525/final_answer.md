## S1: Analysis of Newspaper Opinions in Illustrating Spain’s Venture Capital Situation

To determine whether any newspaper’s opinions are cited or selected to illustrate the situation of venture capital in Spain, we conducted a thorough review of all available materials. The analysis reveals that **no newspaper’s editorial opinions, journalistic commentary, or published articles are referenced or used** to depict or contextualize Spain’s venture capital landscape.

The available content focuses exclusively on quantitative metrics — such as Spain’s venture capital investment-to-GDP ratio of `$0.011$` — and its visual representation in a 2010 bubble chart comparing European countries [rag-1]. These data points serve as empirical indicators rather than interpretive narratives derived from media sources.

Importantly, neither the knowledge base nor any tool execution results indicate the inclusion of journalistic perspectives, opinion pieces, or editorial analyses from newspapers such as *El País*, *La Vanguardia*, or international outlets like *Financial Times* or *The Economist*. The absence of such references suggests that the material relies solely on statistical and comparative economic data, not on media interpretation or public discourse.

In summary, while the material provides useful quantitative benchmarks for understanding Spain’s position in European venture capital, it does not incorporate any newspaper opinions to illustrate or enrich the narrative. This omission may reflect a deliberate focus on objective metrics over subjective commentary, but it also means that no journalistic voice is present in the current documentation.
