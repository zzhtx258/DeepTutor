## S1: Chart Comparison Analysis Between China and Japan

After a thorough review of the available slide content, including all charts and visual artifacts, it is confirmed that **no chart in the slides compares China and Japan**. All comparative visualizations focus exclusively on three regions: **China, Europe, and the USA**, across key venture capital metrics such as average exit capitalization, capital efficiency, mid-stage deal volumes, and investment-to-GDP ratios [rag-1].

This absence is consistent across all provided materials — no mention, data point, or graphical representation includes Japan in any direct or indirect comparison with China. The scope of analysis in the slides is intentionally limited to these three major economic blocs, likely due to their dominant roles in global venture capital activity.

Therefore, if a comparison between China and Japan is required, it would need to be constructed using external data sources or by extending the existing analytical framework beyond the current slide set.

### Summary
There is no chart in the slides that compares China and Japan; all comparisons are restricted to China, Europe, and the USA. This conclusion is directly supported by the available materials and requires no further derivation or calculation.
