The median exit valuation in the USA is approximately **$350 million**, while in Europe it is about **$280 million**. \n\nThis data indicates a significant difference in the median exit valuations between the two regions. Specifically, the USA's median exit valuation exceeds that of Europe by approximately **$70 million**. This difference highlights the disparity in exit valuations, with the USA presenting a more lucrative environment for successful exits compared to Europe.\n\nIn summary, the median exit valuation in the USA is $70 million higher than in Europe, illustrating a notable gap in the financial outcomes for companies exiting in these two regions.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Calculation of the Difference in Median Exit Valuation\n\nTo calculate the difference in median exit valuation between the USA and Europe, we start with the premise that the median exit valuation in the USA is 25% higher than that in Europe. Given the previous context, we know that the median exit valuation in Europe is approximately **$280 million**. \n\n### Calculation Process\n\n1. **Determine the USA's Median Exit Valuation**:\n   The USA's median exit valuation can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{USA Valuation} = \\text{Europe Valuation} \\times 1.25\n   $$\n   Substituting the known value:\n   $$\n   \\text{USA Valuation} = 280 \\text{ million} \\times 1.25 = 350 \\text{ million}\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   The difference in median exit valuations is then:\n   $$\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{USA Valuation} - \\text{Europe Valuation}\n   $$\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   $$\n   \\text{Difference} = 350 \\text{ million} - 280 \\text{ million} = 70 \\text{ million}\n   $$\n\nThus, the median exit valuation in the USA is **$70 million** higher than in Europe, confirming our earlier analysis. This calculation aligns with the data indicating that the USA presents a more favorable environment for successful exits compared to Europe.\n\nIn summary, the median exit valuation in the USA exceeds that of Europe by **$70 million**, reinforcing the significant disparity in exit valuations between these two regions.",
