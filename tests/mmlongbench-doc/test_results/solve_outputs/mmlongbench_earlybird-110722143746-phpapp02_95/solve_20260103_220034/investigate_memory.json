      "raw_result": "The difference in median exit valuation between the USA and Europe is notable. Specifically, the average exit values in Europe are approximately **25% smaller** compared to those in the USA. While both regions achieve successful exits around the **$350 million** mark for companies with exits exceeding **$100 million**, this figure highlights that the US typically has higher average exit valuations despite Europe's rising efficiency in venture capital. \n\nFurthermore, European venture capital demonstrates superior return multiples with a median multiple of cash invested at **7.2** compared to the US’s **4.5**, indicating that while exit amounts may be lower, the efficiency in European capital deployment is higher. This efficiency allows European startups to reach high exit values while investing only half the capital required in the US. \n\nOverall, these statistics exemplify a crucial aspect of the contrasting VC dynamics between the two regions: Europe achieves successful exit valuations with lower capital investments compared to higher valuations in the US.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
