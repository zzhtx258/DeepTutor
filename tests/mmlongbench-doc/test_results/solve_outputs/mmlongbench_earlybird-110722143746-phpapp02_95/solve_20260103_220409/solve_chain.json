Notably, the charts titled 'Early-Stage VC Fundraising Europe' illustrate venture capital fundraising amounts across European countries from the years 2000 to 2004 and compare annual totals from 1999 to around 2005. Additionally, another chart titled 'Revenue Traction per Fund Generation' depicts revenue traction over a five-year period, labeling each year from Year 1 to Year 5.\n\nHowever, upon deeper examination, it was determined that while there are multiple pages containing charts with horizontal axes set as years, none of these charts specifically reference the year 2024. This leads us to conclude that the number of pages with charts whose horizontal axes are set as years like 2024 is **0**.\n\nIn summary, despite the presence of charts with yearly data, there are no references to the year 2024 in the identified materials.",

The focus was specifically on identifying any references to the year 2024 among these charts. \n\nFrom the data reviewed, multiple pages contained charts with horizontal axes set as years. For instance, the chart titled 'Early-Stage VC Fundraising Europe' displayed venture capital fundraising amounts across various European countries from the years 2000 to 2004, while another chart, 'Revenue Traction per Fund Generation,' illustrated revenue traction over a five-year span, labeling each year from Year 1 to Year 5.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that despite the existence of these charts with yearly data, none of them specifically included the year 2024. This observation leads us to conclude that there are **0 pages** that feature charts with horizontal axes set as years like 2024.\n\nIn summary, while we identified several charts with yearly axes, the absence of any reference to the year 2024 confirms that no pages meet the specified criteria.",
