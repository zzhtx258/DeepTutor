      "raw_result": "The venture capital (VC) performance metrics comparing Europe and the United States highlight several key differences that illuminate the current state of both regions in the venture capital landscape.\n\n### Venture Capital Investment Distribution\n- A notable chart demonstrates the disparity in VC investments between the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. consistently receives significantly larger investments, with U.S. venture capital investment reaching approximately $200 billion, while Europe only reaches around $40 billion. This stark contrast reinforces the narrative that Europe receives only one-fifth of U.S. VC investments, suggesting a highly concentrated investment environment in the U.S. (Reference [1]).\n\n### Average Capital Invested and Exit Values\n- Comparative data indicates that while European startups require significantly less investment to achieve comparable exit values, the average exit for VC-backed startups above $100 million is around $350 million for both regions. However, European startups manage to reach these exit values with much lower investment levels, demonstrating higher capital efficiency compared to the U.S. (Reference [1]).\n\n### Performance Metrics: Median Multiple of Cash Invested\n- A distinct chart presents the \"Median Multiple of Cash Invested\" where Europe surpasses the U.S., achieving a median multiple of approximately 7.2x against the U.S.'s 4.5x. This showcases European VC's capacity for generating higher exit multiples globally despite lower average exit sizes. This confirms the narrative of European funds performing well on a return-per-dollar basis relative to investments made (Reference [1]).\n\n### Hit Rate and Capital Efficiency\n- Data indicates that European funds enjoy a higher \"Hit Rate\" (the success rate of investments leading to exits) in comparison as well. European funds achieve a hit rate that suggests better success rates per investment than their U.S. counterparts, even with lower capital requirements. Furthermore, European VC ecosystems exhibit greater capital efficiency, with reports suggesting that efficiency in Europe is about 70% higher than in the U.S. (Reference [1]).\n\n### Post-IPO Performance\n- In examining post-IPO performance, the trends show that while the U.S. generally outperforms Europe in VC-backed IPOs, there are certain time frames where European performance matches or even exceeds its U.S. counterpart. This nuance indicates an evolving landscape where European VC is closing the gap in exit success (Reference [1]).\n\nIn summary, the comparisons show that while U.S. venture capital remains the dominant player in terms of absolute investment amounts, European venture capital is carving out a niche by exhibiting higher efficiency and potentially superior return multiples on investments made.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",

      "raw_result": "### Venture Capital Performance Metrics Comparison: U.S. vs. Europe\n\nThe comparative analysis of venture capital (VC) performance metrics between the United States and Europe reveals fundamental differences in capital efficiency, exit values, and fund performance. Here are key insights drawn from various data visualizations:\n\n1. **Capital Invested and Exit Values**:\n   - **Average Capital Invested Prior to $100M+ Exit**: \n     - In Europe, the average capital invested before achieving a $100M exit is approximately $100 million, while in the U.S., it is close to $200 million. This indicates that European startups require less investment to reach significant exit milestones, showcasing higher capital efficiency (Document Chunk reference_id: \"1\").\n   \n   - **Median Multiple of Cash Invested**: \n     - Europe achieves a median multiple of 7.2x on cash invested compared to the U.S., which has a median multiple of 4.5x. Despite smaller average exit sizes in Europe, the higher multiples indicate better overall returns (Document Chunk reference_id: \"1\").\n\n2. **Exit Performance**:\n   - **Number of Exits Over $100M**: \n     - Europe had 131 exits over $100 million, significantly lower than the U.S.’s 596 exits. However, the higher median multiples suggest that European VCs are achieving superior returns relative to their lower exit volumes (Document Chunk reference_id: \"1\").\n   \n3. **Investment Size Across Stages**:\n   - **Median Investments**:\n     - At various funding stages (Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D+), U.S. investments are generally higher compared to Europe. For instance, the Series A median investment in the U.S. is around $6.2 million, while Europe’s is significantly lower at about $3 million, which highlights the different capital deployment strategies (Document Chunk reference_id: \"1\").\n\n4. **Performance Drivers**:\n   - **Hit Rate and Capital Efficiency**:\n     - European VCs have a better hit rate compared to U.S. VCs, which means a higher percentage of investments lead to successful exits. This is attributed to the selectivity enabled by capital scarcity in Europe, leading to a more disciplined investment approach (Document Chunk reference_id: \"1\").\n\n### Conclusion\nThe charts and metrics outline a compelling narrative: while the U.S. leads in total VC investment and exit volume, European venture capital is characterized by higher capital efficiency, better exit multiples, and an emerging competitive landscape fueled by strong fundamentals.\n\n### References\n- [1] earlybird-110722143746-phpapp02_95.pdf",
