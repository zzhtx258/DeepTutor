      "step_response": "## S1: Evaluating the Feasibility of the User’s Claim\n\nThe user’s question assumes the existence of a chart tracking West Nile Virus (WNV) in Europe that uses color coding—specifically red—to represent distance from the Mississippi River. To assess this claim, we must first examine its logical and geographical coherence.\n\nThe Mississippi River is a major river system located entirely within North America, flowing through the central United States from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico [rag-1]. In contrast, West Nile Virus surveillance in Europe is conducted within the geographical and epidemiological context of the European continent, where transmission is monitored relative to local environmental factors such as wetlands, bird migration routes, and mosquito breeding zones—none of which involve North American geography [rag-1].\n\nThere is no known scientific, public health, or epidemiological chart—whether published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), or any academic institution—that uses the Mississippi River as a spatial reference point for mapping WNV in Europe. Such a practice would be geographically nonsensical, as the river lies over 6,000 kilometers away from the nearest European border and has no ecological, climatic, or vector-related connection to WNV dynamics in Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the available knowledge base and tool search results confirm the absence of any such chart or color-coding scheme linking WNV incidence in Europe to distance from the Mississippi River [rag-1]. No data, visualization, or scholarly reference supports this premise. The claim conflates two entirely unrelated geographic and epidemiological domains.\n\nTherefore, the foundational assumption of the user’s question—that such a chart exists—is factually and logically invalid. The notion that red (or any color) on a European WNV map could represent distance from the Mississippi River lacks any basis in reality.\n\n### Summary  \nThe user’s question is based on a false premise: there is no valid or existing chart that maps West Nile Virus in Europe using distance from the Mississippi River as a variable. The claim is geographically implausible and unsupported by any credible data source.",
