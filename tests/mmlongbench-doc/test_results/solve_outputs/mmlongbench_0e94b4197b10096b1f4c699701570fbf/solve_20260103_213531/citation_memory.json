      "raw_result": "Gestalt psychology originated in the early 20th century, experiencing its conceptual development primarily within the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology. It was established as a response to the then-prevailing schools of thought in psychology, particularly behaviorism and structuralism, which focused on breaking down mental processes into their simplest components. Gestalt psychology instead emphasized understanding the laws that govern how humans perceive and organize sensory information into meaningful wholes.\n\nThe term \"Gestalt,\" which translates to \"shape\" or \"form\" in German, emphasizes that the whole of a perception is fundamentally different from the sum of its parts. This perspective led to the formulation of several key principles or \"laws\" that describe how visual elements are grouped and interpreted by our minds. It advocates the idea that the brain's tendency is to organize visual stimuli into organized patterns rather than as isolated parts.\n\nIn summary, the historical context of Gestalt psychology reflects a significant shift in the study of perception, focusing on holistic processing and delineating how relationships among elements contribute to our understanding of visual experiences.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 0e94b4197b10096b1f4c699701570fbf.pdf",
