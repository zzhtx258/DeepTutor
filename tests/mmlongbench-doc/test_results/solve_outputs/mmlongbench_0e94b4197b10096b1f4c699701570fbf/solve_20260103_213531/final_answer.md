## S1: Historical Context and Significance of Gestalt Psychology's Origin

Gestalt psychology was conceived in the early 20th century, primarily within the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology. This movement emerged as a significant response to the prevailing schools of thought at the time, particularly behaviorism and structuralism. While behaviorism focused on observable behaviors and structuralism aimed to break down mental processes into their most basic components, Gestalt psychology shifted the focus towards understanding how humans perceive and organize sensory information into meaningful wholes.

The term "Gestalt," which translates from German to "shape" or "form," encapsulates the core principle of this psychological approach: perceptions are fundamentally different from the sum of their parts. This idea emphasizes that our cognitive processes are holistic, meaning that we tend to perceive entire structures rather than merely a collection of individual elements. For example, when viewing a complex image, our brains instinctively group visual elements based on certain laws, leading to a unified perception rather than a fragmented one.

This holistic processing is articulated through the Gestalt Laws of Grouping, which explain how we organize visual information. These laws include principles such as proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity, which guide our perception and help us make sense of the visual world around us. By focusing on the relationships among visual elements, Gestalt psychology has profoundly influenced various fields, including cognitive psychology, design, and art, by highlighting the importance of context and organization in perception.

In summary, the origin of Gestalt psychology within the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology marks a pivotal moment in the history of psychology, as it introduced a new perspective that emphasizes the significance of holistic perception and the inherent organization of sensory information. This approach not only challenged existing paradigms but also laid the groundwork for future research in understanding human cognition and perception.

## S2: Summary of the Conception of Gestalt Psychology

Gestalt psychology was conceived in the early 20th century, primarily in Germany, specifically within the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology. This innovative movement was founded by notable psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka. It emerged as a direct response to the reductionist approaches of behaviorism and structuralism, which dominated the psychological landscape at that time.

The core principle of Gestalt psychology is the emphasis on holistic processing, encapsulated in the idea that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." This perspective highlights how humans naturally organize sensory information into meaningful wholes rather than merely perceiving isolated elements. By focusing on the relationships among visual components, Gestalt psychology introduced significant concepts such as the Gestalt Laws of Grouping, which include principles like proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity.

In summary, the conception of Gestalt psychology in early 20th-century Germany marked a pivotal shift in psychological thought, advocating for a holistic understanding of perception that challenged existing paradigms and laid the foundation for future research in cognitive psychology and related fields.
