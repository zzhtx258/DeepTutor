This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form. By minimizing extraneous stimuli, the mind seeks to create meaning and prioritize global regularity over local irregularities.\n\nThis principle emphasizes how the human perceptual system organizes visual information into well-defined wholes rather than focusing on individual components, thereby streamlining perception and understanding.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 0e94b4197b10096b1f4c699701570fbf.pdf",
      "summary": "The Law of Good Gestalt is a principle from Gestalt psychology that states elements of objects are perceptually grouped together if they form a regular, simple, and orderly pattern. This principle suggests that individuals simplify complexity to perceive reality in its most basic form, prioritizing global regularity over local irregularities. It highlights how the human perceptual system organizes visual information into coherent wholes rather than focusing on individual parts.",
