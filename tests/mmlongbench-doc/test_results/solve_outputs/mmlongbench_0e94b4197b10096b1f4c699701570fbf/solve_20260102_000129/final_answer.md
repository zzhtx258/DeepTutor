## S1: Identification of Shapes Illustrating the Closure Principle

The closure aspect of the Gestalt Principle of Visual Perception refers to the human tendency to mentally complete incomplete visual stimuli, perceiving fragmented elements as a unified, whole object even when parts are absent [rag-1]. This principle is frequently leveraged in visual design—particularly in slide presentations—to reduce visual clutter while maintaining immediate recognizability of shapes.

According to the provided materials, the slide specifically employs a **broken ring composed of black line segments** to demonstrate this phenomenon [rag-1]. These segments are not connected, yet the viewer’s perceptual system automatically interpolates the missing portions, resulting in the stable perception of a **complete circle**. This is a classic and widely cited example in visual cognition literature, where discontinuity in the contour does not disrupt the holistic interpretation of the form.

The choice of a circular ring is particularly effective for illustrating closure because:
- The circular shape has a continuous, predictable contour that the brain expects to complete.
- The gaps in the ring are strategically placed to disrupt continuity without obscuring the overall form.
- The use of uniform black line segments ensures visual consistency, minimizing competing cues that might interfere with the perceptual completion process.

This technique exemplifies how minimalistic design can exploit innate perceptual mechanisms to convey complex information efficiently—a core goal in effective slide design.

In summary, the shape used to illustrate closure in the slide is a **circle**, rendered as a set of disconnected black line segments forming an incomplete ring, which the observer perceives as whole due to the Gestalt principle of closure [rag-1].

    The slide illustrates the closure aspect of the Gestalt Principle of Visual Perception using incomplete shapes such as a broken ring of black line segments that are perceived as a complete circle. This technique involves disconnected arcs or line segments that the viewer's mind naturally completes, allowing for minimalist, clutter-free designs that maintain clear recognition of the intended shape.
