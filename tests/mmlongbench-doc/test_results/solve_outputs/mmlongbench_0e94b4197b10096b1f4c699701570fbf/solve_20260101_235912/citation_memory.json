      "raw_result": "The Law of Good Gestalt is a principle from Gestalt psychology that states elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law suggests that the human mind naturally eliminates complexity and unfamiliarity to perceive the world in its most simplistic and coherent form. The perception of a whole, unified pattern is prioritized over individual spatial details or irregularities, meaning that even when elements are not physically connected, their regular arrangement leads the mind to interpret them as a single, harmonious structure.\n\nThis principle emphasizes conciseness and global regularity, where visual stimuli are organized into meaningful wholes by favoring symmetry, repetition, and alignment. Examples of this include geometric arrangements such as evenly spaced circles in a grid or hexagonal pattern, where any deviation (like a single square among circles) is mentally overridden to preserve the perception of order. The law underpins many principles in visual design and data presentation by demonstrating how simplicity and structure guide human perception.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 0e94b4197b10096b1f4c699701570fbf.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The Law of Good Gestalt, as described in the document, states that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This principle implies that when individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity to observe reality in its most simplistic form. The mind prioritizes global regularity over spatial relations or local irregularities, favoring conciseness and structural harmony in visual perception. This law is central to Gestalt theory, which emphasizes that the whole has a reality independent of its parts.\n\nVisual examples in the document reinforce this concept: diagrams show arrangements of identical shapes—such as a 4x4 grid of circles with one replaced by a square, or a hexagonal pattern of six circles—where the viewer perceives the overall pattern as unified and orderly despite minor deviations. These illustrations demonstrate how the human perceptual system actively reduces complexity to derive meaning from simplicity, aligning with the core tenet of the Law of Good Gestalt.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 0e94b4197b10096b1f4c699701570fbf.pdf",
