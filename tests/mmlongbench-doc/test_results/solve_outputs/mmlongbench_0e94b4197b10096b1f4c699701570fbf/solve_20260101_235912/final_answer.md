## S1: Extracting the Core Definition of the Law of Good Gestalt

The Law of Good Gestalt is a foundational principle in Gestalt psychology, which asserts that human perception is inherently inclined to organize visual elements into coherent, unified wholes rather than processing them as isolated components [rag-1]. This principle is consistently articulated across the available sources, with convergence on five key perceptual preferences: **regularity**, **simplicity**, **symmetry**, **structural harmony**, and **unity**.

Specifically, the law states that when elements form patterns that are *regular*, *simple*, and *orderly*, the human mind automatically groups them together—even in the absence of physical connectivity—because such configurations reduce cognitive load and enhance perceptual efficiency [rag-2]. The term “good Gestalt” itself refers to these optimal, stable, and aesthetically pleasing arrangements that the brain favors over chaotic or irregular ones [rag-1]. Importantly, this tendency is not merely aesthetic; it reflects a deeper cognitive strategy of minimizing complexity and unfamiliarity to construct a simplified, integrated representation of the environment [rag-2].

The synthesis of the three provided summaries reveals a unified definition:  
> *The Law of Good Gestalt is a principle in Gestalt psychology stating that humans naturally perceive elements as part of a unified, orderly whole when they form regular, simple, symmetric, and structurally harmonious patterns. The mind prioritizes global coherence over individual details, eliminating complexity and unfamiliarity to simplify visual input into a concise, integrated structure.*

This formulation encapsulates the essential elements identified across all sources: the emphasis on *global structure* over local features [rag-1], the role of *symmetry and repetition* in promoting perceptual grouping [rag-2], and the underlying motivation of *cognitive economy*—the mind’s drive to achieve the most efficient interpretation possible [rag-2]. The principle is not about physical proximity or similarity alone, but about the *perceived integrity* of the whole, consistent with the Gestalt tenet that “the whole is other than the sum of its parts” [rag-2].

In essence, the Law of Good Gestalt describes a perceptual bias toward order: when presented with ambiguous or complex visual stimuli, the brain defaults to interpreting them as structured, balanced, and harmonious configurations, even if minor deviations exist—such as in grids with one misaligned element, where the overall pattern remains perceived as intact [rag-2].

This definition forms the conceptual bedrock for understanding how humans interpret visual design, user interfaces, and natural scenes, and it underpins subsequent Gestalt principles such as closure, continuity, and Prägnanz.

    The Law of Good Gestalt is a principle from Gestalt psychology stating that humans naturally perceive elements as part of a unified, orderly whole when they form regular, simple, and symmetric patterns, even if the elements are not physically connected. The mind prioritizes global structure and coherence over individual details, favoring symmetry, repetition, and alignment to simplify complex visual input.

    The Law of Good Gestalt states that elements are perceptually grouped together when they form a regular, simple, and orderly pattern. The human mind favors simplicity and structural harmony, reducing complexity to perceive the world in its most concise and unified form. This principle is central to Gestalt theory, which holds that the whole has a reality independent of its parts, as demonstrated by visual examples like grids of identical shapes with minor deviations where the overall pattern is still perceived as coherent.
