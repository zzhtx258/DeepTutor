      "step_response": "## S1: Definition and Core Principle of the Law of Good Gestalt\n\nThe **Law of Good Gestalt** is formally defined in the document as a perceptual principle that describes how the human mind instinctively organizes fragmented or complex visual stimuli into **simple, regular, and orderly patterns** in order to reduce cognitive load and construct meaningful, coherent wholes [rag-1]. This tendency reflects an innate neurological preference for clarity, balance, and interpretability — favoring structured, harmonious arrangements over chaotic or disjointed configurations.\n\nThis law is one of the foundational principles within the broader framework of the **Gestalt Laws of Grouping**, which collectively explain how humans perceive and mentally group visual elements based on proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and good form. The “good form” referred to here — *Good Gestalt* — emphasizes the brain’s drive toward perceptual economy: it seeks the most stable, minimal, and aesthetically pleasing interpretation of sensory input.\n\nIn practical applications — particularly in fields like data visualization, graphic design, and user interface development — this law guides designers to structure information in ways that align with natural perceptual tendencies. For example, arranging data points into clean grids, using consistent spacing, or grouping related items visually enhances intuitive comprehension by leveraging the brain’s inherent bias toward order and simplicity [rag-1].\n\nIn essence, the Law of Good Gestalt asserts that perception is not merely passive reception of stimuli, but an active process of organization governed by the principle that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” — and that the mind prefers wholes that are simple, balanced, and easily interpretable.\n\n---\n\nThis definition provides the conceptual foundation necessary to understand how visual coherence is achieved through perceptual organization — a key insight for designing effective visual communication systems.",
