      "raw_result": "The **Law of Good Gestalt** is defined as a perceptual principle stating that the human mind naturally organizes fragmented or complex visual elements into **simple, regular, and orderly patterns** to reduce complexity and create meaningful, coherent wholes. This principle reflects the brain’s preference for perceiving structures that are clear, balanced, and easily interpretable rather than chaotic or disjointed.\n\nThis law is one of the **Gestalt Laws of Grouping**, which collectively explain how humans instinctively group visual stimuli to form unified perceptions. The Law of Good Gestalt specifically emphasizes **simplicity and clarity** in perception — for example, viewers may mentally complete gaps in shapes (Closure) or follow smooth paths across intersections (Continuity) because these interpretations yield more “good” or stable forms.\n\nIt is applied in data visualization to enhance intuitive understanding: maps, infographics, and charts designed with this principle allow audiences to grasp trends or relationships without needing to analyze raw numbers. For instance, the 3D thematic map of West Nile Virus cases and Minard’s 1869 map of Napoleon’s campaign both leverage this law by structuring data in visually coherent, simplified formats that guide perception effortlessly.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Document Title One\n- [2] Document Title Two\n- [3] Document Title Three",
