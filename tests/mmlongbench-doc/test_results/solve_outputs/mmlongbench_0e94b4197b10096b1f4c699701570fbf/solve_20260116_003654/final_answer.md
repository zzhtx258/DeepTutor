## S1: Definition and Core Principle of the Law of Good Gestalt

The **Law of Good Gestalt** is formally defined in the document as a perceptual principle that describes how the human mind instinctively organizes fragmented or complex visual stimuli into **simple, regular, and orderly patterns** in order to reduce cognitive load and construct meaningful, coherent wholes [rag-1]. This tendency reflects an innate neurological preference for clarity, balance, and interpretability — favoring structured, harmonious arrangements over chaotic or disjointed configurations.

This law is one of the foundational principles within the broader framework of the **Gestalt Laws of Grouping**, which collectively explain how humans perceive and mentally group visual elements based on proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and good form. The “good form” referred to here — *Good Gestalt* — emphasizes the brain’s drive toward perceptual economy: it seeks the most stable, minimal, and aesthetically pleasing interpretation of sensory input.

In practical applications — particularly in fields like data visualization, graphic design, and user interface development — this law guides designers to structure information in ways that align with natural perceptual tendencies. For example, arranging data points into clean grids, using consistent spacing, or grouping related items visually enhances intuitive comprehension by leveraging the brain’s inherent bias toward order and simplicity [rag-1].

In essence, the Law of Good Gestalt asserts that perception is not merely passive reception of stimuli, but an active process of organization governed by the principle that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” — and that the mind prefers wholes that are simple, balanced, and easily interpretable.

This definition provides the conceptual foundation necessary to understand how visual coherence is achieved through perceptual organization — a key insight for designing effective visual communication systems.

    The Law of Good Gestalt is defined as a perceptual principle where the human mind organizes fragmented or complex visual elements into simple, regular, and orderly patterns to reduce complexity and create meaningful, coherent wholes. It reflects the brain’s preference for clear, balanced, and easily interpretable structures over chaotic or disjointed ones. This law is part of the Gestalt Laws of Grouping and is applied in data visualization to enhance intuitive understanding by structuring information in visually coherent formats.
