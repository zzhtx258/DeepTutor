However, it does indicate that **425 participants** from **105 countries** registered for the course, highlighting its global reach. The distribution across continents is visually represented in the **CTBT Advanced Science Course Participation and Impact Infographic**, which includes a **world map** marked with red circles to show regional participation counts.\n\nWhile the exact continental figures are not listed in the available context, the infographic’s world map serves as a visual tool to convey the geographic spread of participants. The institutional affiliations of participants are categorized (e.g., universities, research institutes, government agencies), but these categories do not correspond directly to continental distribution.\n\nIn summary, while the report confirms broad international participation spanning 105 countries, it does not offer explicit data on how participants were distributed across continents.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] CTBT Advanced Science Course Participation and Impact Infographic (image)\n- [2] World Map\n- [3] 425 Registered Participants\n- [4] 105 Countries\n- [5] Institutional Affiliation",
