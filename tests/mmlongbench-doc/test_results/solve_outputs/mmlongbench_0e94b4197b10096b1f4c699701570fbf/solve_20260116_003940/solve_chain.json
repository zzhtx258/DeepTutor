      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Continent-Level Participant Data Availability\n\nTo determine which continent has the most registered participants for the CTBTO Advanced Science Course, we must first establish whether such continent-level data is available in the official documentation. The primary source referenced is the *CTBT Advanced Science Course Participation and Impact Infographic*, along with supporting textual reports.\n\nAccording to multiple independent queries and summaries from the available materials [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3], [rag-4], [rag-5], [rag-6], the following facts are consistently confirmed:\n\n- A total of **425 participants** from **105 countries** registered for the course, indicating broad global participation.\n- The infographic includes a **world map** that visually represents regional participation using **red circles** of varying sizes to suggest relative concentration.\n- However, **no exact numerical labels or quantitative breakdowns by continent** (e.g., Asia: X participants, Europe: Y participants) are provided anywhere in the materials.\n- Institutional affiliations are mentioned but do not map directly to continental groupings.\n- Even detailed visual analysis of the world map does not yield quantifiable continental totals — it serves only as a qualitative representation.\n\nIn essence, while the infographic conveys a sense of geographic diversity through its visual design, it deliberately omits precise continental statistics. This absence is consistent across all reviewed documents and search results.\n\nTherefore, based on the current evidence, **it is not possible to determine which continent has the most registered participants**, because the required data — continent-specific participant counts — is not published or derivable from the available materials.\n\n### Summary\nThe CTBTO Advanced Science Course Participation and Impact Infographic confirms global participation (425 participants from 105 countries) and uses a world map with red circles to indicate regional distribution, but it does not provide any numerical or proportional data broken down by continent. As such, no continent can be identified as having the highest number of registered participants based on currently available information.",

      "step_response": "## S2: Conclusion on Continental Participant Breakdown\n\nBased on the comprehensive review of all available materials — including the *CTBT Advanced Science Course Participation and Impact Infographic* and associated textual summaries — it is unequivocally established that **no exact numerical or proportional breakdown of registered participants by continent** is provided. \n\nWhile the infographic visually represents global participation through a world map with red circles of varying sizes [rag-1], this visualization serves only as a qualitative indicator of regional concentration and does not include any labeled data, percentages, or counts for continents such as Asia, Europe, Africa, etc. Furthermore, institutional affiliations mentioned in the reports do not map cleanly to continental groupings, nor can they be aggregated to derive continent-level totals.\n\nThe absence of such data is consistent across all reviewed documents, search results, and analytical attempts. Even if one were to attempt estimation based on country-to-continent mapping (e.g., assigning each of the 105 countries to its respective continent), such an approach would introduce significant uncertainty and lack official validation — thus violating the principle of evidence-based conclusions required here.\n\nTherefore, in strict adherence to the core principles of accuracy and evidence-based reasoning:\n\n> **The question “Which continent has the most number of registered participants for the advanced science course in CTBTO?” cannot be answered with the currently available data.**\n\nThis conclusion is not due to insufficient effort or incomplete search, but rather because the foundational data — continent-specific participant counts — simply does not exist in the published materials.\n\n### Summary\nDespite broad global participation (425 participants from 105 countries), no official or derivable continental breakdown exists in the CTBTO’s published materials. As such, identifying the continent with the highest number of registered participants remains unanswerable based on current evidence.",
