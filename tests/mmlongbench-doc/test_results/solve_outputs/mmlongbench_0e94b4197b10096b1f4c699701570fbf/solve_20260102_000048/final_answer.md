## S1: Analysis of Participant Data Availability by Continent

To determine whether information about registered participants for the CTBTO (Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) advanced science course segmented by continent exists, a systematic review of the available knowledge base and tool execution results was conducted. The query specifically sought data on participant counts categorized by geographic continent — a necessary prerequisite to identifying which continent has the highest number of registrations.

The knowledge base was queried using two distinct but semantically equivalent formulations: “CTBTO advanced science course registered participants by continent” and “CTBTO advanced science course participant statistics by continent.” Both queries returned consistent results: no relevant data was found in any of the provided context fragments. The raw excerpts explicitly state that while general educational content (e.g., classroom settings, cell biology diagrams, NASA timelines) is present, there is *no mention* of CTBTO or its educational initiatives, including advanced science courses or participant demographics [rag-1][rag-2].

Furthermore, no external tool execution (e.g., database search, API query, or web retrieval) was able to retrieve any supplementary data, as indicated by the “none” status in the tool results. The summary from the tool execution confirms: *“No information about registered participants for the CTBTO advanced science course segmented by continent exists in the available knowledge base.”*

Given that the absence of data is corroborated across multiple independent sources within the knowledge base and no external data retrieval was possible, it is concluded that the foundational information required to answer the user’s question — namely, participant counts by continent — is not available.

### Summary
There is currently no available data on registered participants for the CTBTO advanced science course segmented by continent. Without this baseline information, it is impossible to determine which continent has the most participants.
