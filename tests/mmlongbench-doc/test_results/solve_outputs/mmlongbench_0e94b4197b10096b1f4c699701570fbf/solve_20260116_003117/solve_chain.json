      "step_response": "## S1: Origin of Gestalt Psychology\n\nGestalt psychology was conceived at the **Berlin School of Experimental Psychology**, which is widely recognized as its institutional birthplace [rag-2]. This school, located in Berlin, Germany, served as the intellectual and experimental hub where foundational principles of Gestalt theory were developed in the early 20th century. The core tenet of Gestalt psychology — that humans perceive objects and patterns as meaningful wholes rather than isolated parts — emerged from research conducted within this academic environment.\n\nThe term “Gestalt,” derived from German, translates to “form” or “whole,” reflecting the school’s emphasis on holistic perception. Key figures such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler, who were affiliated with the Berlin School, played pivotal roles in formalizing these ideas through experiments on visual perception, motion, and problem-solving.\n\nThus, the conception of Gestalt psychology is geographically and institutionally anchored in Berlin, specifically within the framework of the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology.\n\nThis step establishes the origin point for further exploration of Gestalt principles, their development, and their influence on modern cognitive psychology.",
