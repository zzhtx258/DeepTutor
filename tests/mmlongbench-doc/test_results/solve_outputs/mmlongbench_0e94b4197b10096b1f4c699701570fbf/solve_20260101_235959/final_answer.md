## S1: Assessment of Data Sufficiency for Weekend Time Use Trends (2005–2010)

To determine whether an increase in time spent on weekends across categories can be assessed from 2005 to 2010, we must first establish whether the necessary data exists. The question implicitly requires longitudinal time-use statistics categorized by activity (e.g., leisure, work, household tasks) specifically during weekend periods, comparing two distinct years: 2005 and 2010. Such data would typically be sourced from national time-use surveys, labor statistics, or behavioral studies tracking daily activity patterns.

However, all available materials consistently indicate a lack of relevant data. Multiple knowledge base entries explicitly state that “there is insufficient data available to determine which category had the most increase in time spent on weekends from 2005 to 2010” [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3]. The provided documents reference unrelated topics—such as banana exports (1994–2005), U.S. healthcare spending (1960–2007), and NASA spaceflight durations—but contain no information on weekend time allocation, behavioral trends, or categorical time-use metrics for the specified period [rag-2]. Furthermore, no tool execution or external data retrieval yielded any tabular, statistical, or visual dataset pertaining to weekend time use.

Since no quantitative values for time spent in any category on weekends exist for either 2005 or 2010, it is mathematically and statistically impossible to compute an increase ($\Delta t = t_{2010} - t_{2005}$) for any category, let alone identify the one with the greatest increase. The absence of baseline data renders any comparative analysis infeasible.

No images or supplementary visualizations are available to compensate for this data gap, and no code-based analysis could be executed due to the lack of input data.

### Summary
There is insufficient data to assess the increase in time spent on weekends across any category from 2005 to 2010. The foundational time-use statistics required for such an analysis are not present in any of the provided sources.
