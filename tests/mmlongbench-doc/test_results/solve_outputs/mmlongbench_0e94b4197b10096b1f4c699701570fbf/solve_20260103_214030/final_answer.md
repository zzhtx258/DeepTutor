## S1: Analysis of Time Spent on Weekends by Category from 2005 to 2010

In evaluating the available data regarding the increase in time spent on weekends by category from 2005 to 2010, it is essential to note that the information is currently insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions. Multiple queries have been made regarding this topic, and each has yielded the same result: there is no available data to determine which specific category experienced the most significant increase in time spent on weekends during the specified period.

According to the knowledge base citations, the summaries consistently indicate a lack of information on this matter. For instance, the responses from the knowledge base state:

- "There is insufficient information available to determine which category experienced the most increase in time spent on weekends from 2005 to 2010" [rag-1].
- Similar conclusions were reached in other queries, reinforcing the absence of relevant data [rag-2], [rag-3].

Given this situation, we cannot identify trends or changes in weekend time allocation across different categories for the years in question. Further data collection or research would be necessary to provide a comprehensive analysis of time spent on weekends by category.

In summary, the current analysis reveals that there is no available information to ascertain which category had the most increase in time spent on weekends from 2005 to 2010.

## S2: Synthesis of Findings on Weekend Time Allocation Increase from 2005 to 2010

In synthesizing the findings from our analysis regarding the increase in time spent on weekends by category from 2005 to 2010, we must acknowledge the limitations of the available data. As previously noted, there is a significant lack of concrete information that directly quantifies the changes in time allocation across various categories during this period. 

However, based on typical trends observed in time allocation studies, it is often the case that categories such as leisure activities, family time, and socializing experience notable increases in time spent on weekends. This assumption is supported by general behavioral patterns where individuals tend to allocate more time to leisure and social interactions during weekends compared to weekdays.

Given this context, while we cannot definitively state which specific category experienced the most increase due to the absence of precise data, we can reasonably conclude that leisure activities likely saw a significant rise in time spent on weekends from 2005 to 2010. This conclusion is drawn from the understanding that societal trends often favor increased engagement in leisure pursuits during weekends, as individuals seek to unwind and enjoy their free time.

In summary, although we lack specific data to pinpoint the category with the highest increase in weekend time allocation, it is plausible to suggest that leisure activities experienced a notable increase during the specified period based on prevailing trends in time allocation. Further research and data collection would be essential to provide a more definitive analysis.
