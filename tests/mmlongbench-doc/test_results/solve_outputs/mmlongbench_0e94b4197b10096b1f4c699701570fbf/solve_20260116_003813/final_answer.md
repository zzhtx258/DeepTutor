## S1: Identifying the Category with the Largest Increase in Weekend Time (2005–2010)

To determine which category experienced the greatest increase in time spent on weekends from 2005 to 2010, we analyze the percentage point changes across all recorded activities. According to the comparative infographic titled **“Time Spent On Weekends”**, which visualizes weekend activity allocation using dual clock-style pie charts for both years, the data reveals clear trends in behavioral shifts over this five-year period [rag-1].

The most significant increase occurred in the category **“Eating out”**, which rose from **10%** in 2005 to **17%** in 2010 — a net gain of **7 percentage points**. This is the largest absolute increase among all categories.

Other categories also saw growth, though less pronounced:
- **Hobbies**: increased from 2% to 4% (+2 percentage points)
- **Watching films**: increased from 20% to 22% (+2 percentage points)
- Modest gains were observed in **Fitness**, **Travelling**, and **Net surfing**

In contrast, the category **“With family and friends”** experienced a sharp decline, falling from 35% to 21% (−14 percentage points), indicating a major reallocation of weekend time away from social gatherings toward other leisure activities.

Thus, based on the available data, **“Eating out”** stands out as the category with the most substantial growth in weekend time allocation between 2005 and 2010.

### Summary
The category “Eating out” had the largest increase in weekend time spent, rising by 7 percentage points from 10% to 17% between 2005 and 2010, surpassing all other categories in growth magnitude.
