## S1: Geographic Scope Clarification — Red Color and Mississippi River Distance in West Nile Virus Chart

The chart referenced in the question, titled *“Tracking the West Nile Virus”*, is explicitly focused on the **United States**, not Europe. As such, any color coding — including red — is calibrated to U.S.-specific geographic references, most notably the **Mississippi River** [rag-1]. In this U.S.-centric visualization, the red color represents states located within a distance range of **0–375 miles** from the Mississippi River [rag-1].

However, the question asks about the meaning of red color in relation to the Mississippi River **in Europe**. This presents a fundamental geographic inconsistency: the **Mississippi River does not exist in Europe**, nor is there any chart or dataset in the provided materials that maps West Nile Virus cases in Europe using the Mississippi River as a reference point [rag-1]. Consequently, **red color does not represent any distance range from the Mississippi River in Europe**, because such a mapping is geographically and contextually invalid.

In summary, the premise of the question conflates two incompatible geographic domains — the United States (where the chart and river are relevant) and Europe (where neither applies). Therefore, no meaningful distance range can be assigned to red color in the context of European geography with respect to the Mississippi River.

    What are the EXACT numbers/values/labels shown in the chart that tracks West Nile Virus in Europe, specifically regarding the distance ranges represented by red color from the Mississippi River?

    The chart tracking West Nile Virus in the provided context is focused on the United States, not Europe. In this U.S.-focused map, red color represents states located 0–375 miles from the Mississippi River. There is no data or chart for Europe, and no distance ranges from the Mississippi River are defined for European regions — because such data does not exist in the materials. The question may be based on a misunderstanding of geographic scope.
