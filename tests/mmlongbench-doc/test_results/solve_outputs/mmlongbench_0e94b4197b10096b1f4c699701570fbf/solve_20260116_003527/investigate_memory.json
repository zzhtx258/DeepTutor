      "raw_result": "The provided context does not contain any chart or data tracking West Nile Virus in Europe. Furthermore, the **Mississippi River** is a geographic reference point used specifically in the **United States** for the 3D Thematic Map titled *“Tracking the West Nile Virus”*, which visualizes case counts and distance from the river within U.S. states.\n\nAccording to the context:\n\n- The **Color Scale** used in the U.S.-focused map assigns **red** to states located **0–375 miles** from the Mississippi River.\n- This encoding system applies only to U.S. states and does not extend to Europe.\n- There is no mention of any European data, charts, or color-coded distance ranges related to the Mississippi River outside the U.S.\n\nTherefore, there are **no exact numbers, values, or labels** in the context regarding West Nile Virus in Europe or red-colored distance ranges from the Mississippi River in that region — because such data does not exist in the provided materials.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Color Scale\n- [2] 3D Thematic Map\n- [3] Mississippi River\n- [4] West Nile Virus\n- [5] West_Nile_Virus_3D_US_Map_with_Dual_Encoding (image)",
      "summary": "The chart tracking West Nile Virus in the provided context is focused on the United States, not Europe. In this U.S.-focused map, red color represents states located 0–375 miles from the Mississippi River. There is no data or chart for Europe, and no distance ranges from the Mississippi River are defined for European regions — because such data does not exist in the materials. The question may be based on a misunderstanding of geographic scope.",
