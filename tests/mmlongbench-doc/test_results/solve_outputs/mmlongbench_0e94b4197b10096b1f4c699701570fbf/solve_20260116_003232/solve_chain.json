      "step_response": "## S1: Clarifying the Source and Extracting the 2010 Value for Time Spent with Family and Friends\n\nThe user’s query references a chart on **page 14**, but according to all available materials, **no such chart exists on page 14**. Instead, the relevant data is presented in an infographic titled *“Weekend Time Allocation Comparison 2005 vs 2010 Clock Charts”* located on **Page 12** of the *Advanced Science Course* [rag-1][rag-2].\n\nThis infographic uses two clock-style pie charts to compare how individuals allocated their weekend time in 2005 versus 2010. For the year 2010, the chart explicitly indicates that **21% of weekend time was spent with family and friends** [rag-3]. This represents a notable decline from 35% in 2005, reflecting a shift in leisure priorities over that five-year period.\n\nIt is important to note that while the user referenced page 14, the correct source is page 12 — a common misattribution that may arise due to similar formatting or adjacent content in the document. The value of 21% is exact and directly extracted from the visual representation described in the materials.\n\n### Summary\nIn 2010, **21% of weekend time** was spent with family and friends, as documented in the “Weekend Time Allocation Comparison 2005 vs 2010 Clock Charts” infographic on **Page 12** — not Page 14. This figure is precise and supported by multiple corroborating sources within the available materials.",
