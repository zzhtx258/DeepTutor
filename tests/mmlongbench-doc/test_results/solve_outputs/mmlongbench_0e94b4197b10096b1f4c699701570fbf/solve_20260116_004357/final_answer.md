## S1: Identification of Shapes Illustrating the Closure Principle

The Gestalt Principle of Visual Perception, particularly the **Closure** aspect, describes how the human brain tends to perceive complete shapes even when visual elements are fragmented or incomplete. This perceptual tendency allows us to mentally “fill in” gaps and recognize familiar forms from partial information.

Based on the provided materials, the slide employs the following specific shapes to demonstrate this principle:

- **Incomplete Circle**: Constructed from six short, curved line segments arranged radially, this figure creates the illusion of a full circle as the viewer’s mind completes the missing arcs.  
- **Incomplete Rectangle**: Formed by eight straight line segments positioned to suggest the corners and edges of a rectangle, the brain perceives a complete rectangular shape despite the absence of connecting lines.  
- **Pac-Man-like Figures**: These consist of three circular sectors (resembling Pac-Man characters) oriented such that their negative space — the area between them — is perceived as an equilateral triangle.  
- **Starburst Pattern**: Composed of triangular spikes radiating outward from a central circular void, this arrangement encourages the viewer to perceive a cohesive star-like form, even though no continuous outline exists.

All these examples are presented in black-and-white diagrams to emphasize the role of perceptual completion without relying on color or texture cues [rag-1].

These visual demonstrations effectively illustrate how closure operates in everyday perception — our minds naturally seek wholeness and continuity, even in the face of visual fragmentation.

The slide thus uses four distinct configurations — incomplete circle, incomplete rectangle, Pac-Man negative-space triangle, and starburst pattern — to concretely exemplify the Closure principle within Gestalt theory.

    The slide uses several shapes to illustrate the closure aspect of the Gestalt Principle: an incomplete circle made of six curved segments, an incomplete rectangle formed by eight straight line segments, Pac-Man-like figures whose negative space forms an equilateral triangle, and a starburst pattern with triangular spikes radiating from a central circular void. These are presented in black-and-white diagrams to highlight how the brain perceives complete shapes from fragmented elements.
