      "raw_result": "The slide illustrates the **Closure** aspect of the Gestalt Principle of Visual Perception using several specific shapes and arrangements:\n\n- **Incomplete Circle**: Composed of six short, curved line segments arranged radially, this figure creates the illusion of a whole circle as the viewer’s mind fills in the missing gaps.\n- **Incomplete Rectangle**: Made up of eight straight line segments (two vertical and two horizontal per side) with consistent spacing, it gives the impression of a continuous rectangular boundary despite its fragmented form.\n- **Pac-Man-Like Figures**: Three black geometric shapes resembling circles with triangular wedges removed are arranged so that their negative space forms an **Equilateral Triangle**, demonstrating how closure allows perception of a complete shape from incomplete elements.\n- **Starburst Pattern**: Created by multiple black triangular spikes radiating outward from a **Central Circular Void**, this pattern exemplifies the Law of Good Gestalt but also relies on closure to be perceived as a unified, orderly whole.\n\nThese shapes are typically presented against a plain white or light gray background to enhance contrast and emphasize perceptual completion. They appear in diagrams such as the *Gestalt Closure Principle Diagram*, *Gestalt Closure Illusion Diagram*, and *Minimalist Black-And-White Line Drawing*, all designed to visually demonstrate how the human brain organizes fragmented visual information into coherent wholes.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Gestalt Closure Principle Diagram (image)\n- [2] Gestalt Closure Illusion Diagram (image)\n- [3] Minimalist Black-And-White Line Drawing\n- [4] Incomplete Circle\n- [5] Incomplete Rectangle",
      "summary": "The slide uses several shapes to illustrate the closure aspect of the Gestalt Principle: an incomplete circle made of six curved segments, an incomplete rectangle formed by eight straight line segments, Pac-Man-like figures whose negative space forms an equilateral triangle, and a starburst pattern with triangular spikes radiating from a central circular void. These are presented in black-and-white diagrams to highlight how the brain perceives complete shapes from fragmented elements.",
