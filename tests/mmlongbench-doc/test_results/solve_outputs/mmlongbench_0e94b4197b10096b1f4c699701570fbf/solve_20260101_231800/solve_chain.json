To determine whether this data is accessible, a systematic search was conducted across all available knowledge sources, including structured queries targeting the exact phrase “time spent with family and friends 2010 chart page 14” and related variants such as “time use survey 2010 family and friends activity duration page 14” [rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3]. Additionally, no tool execution or external data retrieval returned any relevant results.\n\nAll retrieved context chunks, whether from document fragments, knowledge graph entries, or reference lists, consistently confirm the absence of any mention of page 14, any chart related to time use in 2010, or quantitative data concerning social time allocation with family and friends during that year. The search results explicitly state: *“None of the provided context... contains any reference to such a chart, nor any data related to time spent with family and friends in 2010.”* [rag-1].\n\nFurthermore, no image artifacts or visual data were generated or provided that could supplement or substitute for the missing chart. Therefore, the foundational data required to answer the original question is not present in the available materials.\n\nIn summary, the requested information — time spent with family and friends in 2010 from a chart on page 14 — is unavailable in the provided knowledge base. No supporting evidence, textual or visual, exists to permit a quantitative response.",
