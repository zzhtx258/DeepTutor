It was conceived as a framework to understand the laws underlying human perception, particularly how individuals acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions of the world. The term “Gestalt,” derived from the German word meaning “shape” or “form,” reflects its core tenet that the whole is perceived as more than the sum of its parts.\n\nThis school of thought emphasized that perceptual organization is governed by innate principles, leading to the development of the Gestalt Laws of Grouping, which remain influential in fields such as design, cognitive science, and data visualization.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 0e94b4197b10096b1f4c699701570fbf.pdf",
