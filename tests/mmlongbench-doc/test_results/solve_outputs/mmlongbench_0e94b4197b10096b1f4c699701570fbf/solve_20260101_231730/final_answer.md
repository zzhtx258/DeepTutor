## S1: Identifying the Origin of Gestalt Psychology

Gestalt psychology was conceived in the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology, a prominent intellectual hub in early 20th-century Germany where researchers sought to understand perception not as a collection of isolated sensory elements, but as organized, meaningful wholes [rag-1]. This foundational insight directly challenged the atomistic approaches of structuralism and associationism, which dominated psychological thought at the time. The term “Gestalt,” derived from the German word meaning “form” or “shape,” encapsulates the core principle that perceptual experience is inherently structured and that the whole possesses properties not deducible from its individual components—a doctrine often summarized as “the whole is more than the sum of its parts” [rag-1].

The Berlin School provided the institutional and intellectual environment in which key figures such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler developed and formalized Gestalt theory during the 1910s and 1920s. Their experimental work on apparent motion (e.g., the phi phenomenon) demonstrated that perception is an active, organizational process, further cementing Berlin as the conceptual birthplace of this school of thought [rag-1].

Thus, based on the available evidence, the origin and conceptual birthplace of Gestalt psychology is unequivocally the Berlin School of Experimental Psychology.

Gestalt psychology emerged as a direct response to reductionist models of perception, and its foundational principles were crystallized through collaborative research in Berlin, making it the definitive cradle of this influential psychological framework.
