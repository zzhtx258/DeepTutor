This Jupyter Notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for participants, providing step-by-step instructions on generating interactive, layered maps that utilize geographic data sourced from Wikidata.\n\nThe notebook employs various Python libraries, including `ipyleaflet`, `folium`, and `geopandas`, to facilitate the visualization of geospatial data. A notable focus of this module is on public libraries in the Netherlands, allowing users to create dynamic maps that can be exported as standalone HTML pages. One example output from this module is the **'NetherlandsPublicLibrariesHeatmap.html'**, which showcases a heatmap visualizing the distribution of public libraries across the country.\n\nThrough this hands-on approach, participants not only learn to render maps but also gain insights into configuring map features, executing SPARQL queries, and modifying code snippets to enhance their learning experience. This interactive format encourages engagement and practical application of the concepts covered in the workshop.",

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to guide participants through the process of integrating mapping functionalities into their applications, utilizing a variety of Python libraries such as `ipyleaflet`, `folium`, and `geopandas`. \n\nThe primary purpose of this notebook is to provide a hands-on learning experience that enables users to visualize geospatial data effectively. It focuses on public libraries in the Netherlands, allowing users to create dynamic, layered maps that can be exported as standalone HTML pages. For instance, one of the example outputs generated is the **'NetherlandsPublicLibrariesHeatmap.html'**, which visually represents the distribution of public libraries across the country through a heatmap format.\n\nMoreover, the notebook emphasizes interactive features such as zooming, panning, and displaying data points, which are crucial for enhancing user engagement with the maps. By executing SPARQL queries and modifying code snippets, participants not only learn to render maps but also gain insights into the practical applications of interactive maps in data visualization. This comprehensive approach fosters a deeper understanding of how geographic data can be utilized in various contexts, making the learning experience both informative and applicable.\n\nIn summary, the example notebook in Module 3 not only showcases the technical aspects of creating interactive maps but also emphasizes their significance in data visualization, thereby equipping participants with the necessary skills to implement these functionalities in their own projects.",
