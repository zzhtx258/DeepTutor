Below is an overview of the components involved in this module:\n\n### Overview of Module 3: Interactive Layered Maps\n\n- **Title**: `WikidataMapMakingWorkshop.ipynb`\n- **Purpose**: This module enables participants to generate dynamic maps utilizing geographic data sourced from Wikidata. The output is intended to be a standalone HTML page that users can view in their web browsers, showcasing an interactive visualization.\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Utilization of SPARQL Queries**:\n   - SPARQL queries are used to retrieve geo-referenced items (Property P625) from Wikidata. These queries include filtering and data manipulation steps to prepare data for mapping.\n\n2. **Interactive Visualization**:\n   - The visual components are primarily created using libraries such as `ipyleaflet`, which allows users to interact with the map (zooming, panning) through an interface rendered in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n3. **Example Implementation**:\n   - The map might be centered around specific geographic coordinates, such as the Schoorl Public Library in North Holland, using defined attributes like zoom level and layout settings.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The final product includes an exported interactive map directly viewable in web browsers, showcasing features like library locations and density across municipalities. An example output file often mentioned is `NetherlandsPublicLibrariesHeatmap.html`, which reflects a heatmap of public libraries.\n\n### Visual Output\n\n- The notebook interface includes visual outputs such as:\n  - Layered maps displaying data points (e.g., library locations) with distinct markers.\n  - Interactive controls enabling users to manipulate the display of various data layers.\n\n- A focus on clean, academic, and tool-oriented aesthetics is maintained throughout to align with educational content focused on data science.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nModule 3 encapsulates the hands-on learning experience necessary for participants to build interactive, data-driven maps that utilize Wikidata effectively, enhancing their ability to create compelling visual stories from public datasets.\n\n### References\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
