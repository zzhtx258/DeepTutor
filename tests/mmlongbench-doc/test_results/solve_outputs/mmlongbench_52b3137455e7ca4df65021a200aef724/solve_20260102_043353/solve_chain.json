This designation is consistently affirmed across multiple sources within the material, including the workshop outline and accompanying visual analyses, which align with the module’s thematic focus on foundational cartographic representations [rag-1]. No conflicting or alternative titles are present in the available evidence, and no additional tool-generated data contradicts this assertion. Therefore, based solely on the authoritative reference [rag-1], the title of Module 1 is unambiguously confirmed.\n\nThe absence of images or code outputs in this step reflects that the required information is directly and sufficiently provided through textual evidence, eliminating the need for further computational or visual verification.\n\nIn summary, the title of Module 1 is **'Basic flat & layered maps'** [rag-1].",
