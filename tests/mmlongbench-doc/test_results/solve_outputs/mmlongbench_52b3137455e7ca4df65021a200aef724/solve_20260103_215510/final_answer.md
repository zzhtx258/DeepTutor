## S1: Color of the Zone Mali in the GeoShapes Map

In analyzing the map used to demonstrate GeoShapes through SPARQL and OpenStreetMap (OSM), we identify the specific color associated with the zone of Mali. According to the provided data, the zone for Mali is represented by the hex color value **#6A5ACD**. 

This color is part of a systematic color gradient that visually categorizes countries based on their area. Specifically, the hex value **#6A5ACD** is designated for countries that have an area ranging from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 square kilometers. This classification helps in distinguishing countries visually on the map, enhancing the understanding of geographical data representation.

In summary, the zone of Mali is colored **#6A5ACD** in the GeoShapes map, reflecting its significant land area within the specified range.

## S2: Integration of Findings about the Color of the Zone Mali

In our analysis of the GeoShapes map utilized for demonstrating SPARQL and OpenStreetMap (OSM), we have established the color representation for the zone of Mali. Initially, we identified that Mali is represented by the hex color value **#6A5ACD**, which corresponds to a shade of medium slate blue. This color categorization is part of a systematic gradient that visually differentiates countries based on their land area, specifically for those with an area ranging from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 square kilometers.

However, further investigation into the specifics of the map style reveals that the color representation can vary. It has been noted that Mali may also be depicted in a specific shade of brown or beige, contingent upon the particular style of the map being used. This variability indicates that while the hex color **#6A5ACD** is a standard representation, the actual visual output can differ based on stylistic choices in the mapping software.

In summary, the zone of Mali is primarily colored **#6A5ACD** in the GeoShapes map, but it may also appear in shades of brown or beige depending on the map style applied. This duality in color representation emphasizes the importance of understanding the context and design choices in geographical data visualization.
