      "raw_result": "The table on page 98 contains a directory listing from a PAWS (Python Analysis With Sage) environment hosted on wmflabs.org, likely used by Wikimedia GLAM contributors for data science tasks involving Wikidata and public library datasets. It includes three columns: \"File Name,\" \"File Size,\" and \"Date.\" Directory entries (ending in \"/\") do not have file sizes listed, while .ipynb Jupyter notebook files include explicit sizes, indicating they are executable code artifacts.\n\nKey files and their sizes include:\n- `DutchPublicLibraries_OpenStreetMap.ipynb`: 442,444 bytes (the largest notebook, suggesting extensive geospatial data processing)\n- `DutchPublicLibraries_GoogleMaps_Test.ipynb`: 18,132 bytes (a smaller companion test file)\n- `UniversalBot.ipynb`: 555 bytes (a minimal file, likely a prototype or template)\n- `VariousTests.ipynb`: 8,704 bytes\n\nThe table also lists directories such as `Wikibase_Universal_Bot/`, `WikidataMapMakingWorkshop/`, and `node_modules/`, with their respective modification dates, indicating active development and tooling dependencies. The most recent directory, `WikidataMapMakingWorkshop/`, was last modified on 22-Oct-2019, consistent with ongoing workshop development.\n\nThis table illustrates the practical implementation of Anaconda’s data science stack (pandas, Jupyter, etc.) and reflects the use of hybrid Python/JavaScript tools for geospatial analysis tied to Wikimedia-linked datasets.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
