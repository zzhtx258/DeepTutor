## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification of the Two Smallest Files from Page 98

To determine the sum of the file sizes of the two smallest files, we first identify the files with the minimum sizes from the directory listing on page 98, as described in the available knowledge [rag-2]. The table contains entries for Python notebook files in a PAWS environment, with each file accompanied by its size in bytes. According to the provided data, the two files with the smallest file sizes are:

- **UniversalBot.ipynb**: 555 bytes  
- **VariousTests.ipynb**: 8,704 bytes  

These values are explicitly stated in the raw excerpt and summary from the knowledge base, and no other files in the table are reported to be smaller than these two [rag-2]. No additional tool results or images are available to contradict or supplement this information.

Thus, the two smallest files are unambiguously identified as UniversalBot.ipynb and VariousTests.ipynb, with their respective sizes confirmed as 555 bytes and 8,704 bytes.

### Summary
The two files with the smallest sizes on page 98 are UniversalBot.ipynb (555 bytes) and VariousTests.ipynb (8,704 bytes), as directly stated in the available knowledge [rag-2].

## S2: Computation of the Sum of the Two Smallest File Sizes

Having identified the two smallest files—`UniversalBot.ipynb` at 555 bytes and `VariousTests.ipynb` at 8,704 bytes—we now compute their combined file size by summing their individual sizes [rag-2]. This is a straightforward arithmetic operation:

$$
555 + 8{,}704 = 9{,}259 \text{ bytes}
$$

This result is explicitly confirmed in the available knowledge base, which states that the combined size of these two files is 9,259 bytes [rag-2]. The addition is exact and requires no approximation, as both values are given as precise integer measurements in bytes. No rounding, scaling, or unit conversion is necessary, as both sizes are already expressed in the same unit (bytes).

The sum, 9,259 bytes, represents the total storage footprint of the two smallest files in the directory listing on page 98. This value is consistent across both the raw data excerpt and the summarized conclusion provided in the knowledge source [rag-2].

### Summary
The sum of the file sizes of the two smallest files, 555 bytes and 8,704 bytes, is 9,259 bytes, as directly supported by the available evidence [rag-2].
