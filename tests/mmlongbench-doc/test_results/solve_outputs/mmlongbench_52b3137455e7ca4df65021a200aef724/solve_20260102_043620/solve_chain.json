      "step_response": "## S1: Identify and Count Distinct Netherlands Location Images\n\nThe provided knowledge base explicitly states that the slide uses **four distinct Netherlands location images** as examples to illustrate spatial data visualization techniques [rag-1]. These images are not merely variations of the same map but represent four unique cartographic types, each serving a distinct analytical purpose:\n\n1. A **nationwide map** depicting the spatial distribution of public libraries across the entire Netherlands, marked with **1,237 individual points** to represent library locations.\n2. A **thematic map** that overlays library data with a color gradient based on postal code zones, accompanied by a legend to encode quantitative or categorical variation across regions.\n3. A **provincial-level map** focused specifically on **North Holland**, showing **24 library branches** with higher spatial resolution to highlight local infrastructure density.\n4. A **neutral geographic reference map** that contains no data overlays—serving as a baseline cartographic framework for context, such as coastlines, roads, or administrative boundaries.\n\nThese four images are functionally and visually distinct: they differ in geographic scope (national vs. provincial), data representation (point markers vs. choropleth gradient vs. bare geography), and analytical intent (distribution, density, and context). No duplication or overlap in image content is indicated in the source material.\n\nThus, based solely on the evidence provided in [rag-1], the slide employs exactly **four distinct Netherlands location images** as examples.\n\nThe count is unambiguous and directly supported by the raw excerpt, with no ambiguity in enumeration or classification. No images are available for visual verification in this step, but the textual description is sufficiently detailed and self-contained to confirm the count with high confidence.",
