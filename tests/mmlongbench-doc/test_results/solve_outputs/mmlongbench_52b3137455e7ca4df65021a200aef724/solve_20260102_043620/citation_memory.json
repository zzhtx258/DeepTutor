      "raw_result": "The provided context contains multiple geographic map images depicting the spatial distribution of public libraries across the Netherlands, each serving as a visual example suitable for a slide presentation on Dutch locations and infrastructure. These maps are generated using geospatial data from Wikidata and rendered via Wikimedia’s MapFrame technology, making them ideal for educational, administrative, or research-based presentations.\n\nOne prominent example is the map titled *“Map of Dutch public libraries, work in progress, 21-5-2019”*, which appears in multiple iterations across the dataset. It displays 1,237 small blue or dark red circular markers distributed across the country, each representing a public library location. These markers are densely clustered in the Randstad region — encompassing Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht — reflecting high population density and urban service coverage. In contrast, the eastern and northern provinces such as Drenthe, Friesland, and Groningen show sparse marker distribution, highlighting regional disparities in library access. The map uses a minimalist cartographic style with a light beige land background, blue water bodies, and faint provincial boundaries, ensuring clarity for audience interpretation without visual clutter. The absence of legends or individual labels emphasizes aggregate patterns over point-specific details, aligning with slide design best practices for high-level overviews.\n\nAnother relevant example is a thematic map that layers public libraries by postal code zones (e.g., 1000–1999 to 9000–9999), using a color gradient from light blue to dark red/purple to represent different postal ranges. This visualization, derived from SPARQL queries parsing postal code prefixes (P281), demonstrates how administrative data can be spatially stratified. A legend on the right side correlates colors to postal zones, making it suitable for slides focused on service equity, urban planning, or data-driven policy analysis. The map retains the same minimalist base layer and focuses on regional clustering, reinforcing insights about urban-rural divides in public infrastructure.\n\nFor presentations requiring provincial-level analysis, a map of North Holland (Q701) is available, featuring a semi-transparent blue geomask outlining the province’s boundaries and 24 orange markers representing local library branches. This example illustrates how geospatial filtering can isolate regional data — useful for municipal or provincial presentations. Similarly, a basic embedded map centered on latitude 52.20 and longitude 5.18, with no data overlays, serves as a neutral geographic reference for contextualizing library locations within the broader Dutch landscape.\n\nAll these maps are rendered in a uniform, clean vector style consistent with Wikimedia’s cartographic standards, ensuring compatibility with presentation software and scalability without pixelation. Their origins in open, queryable datasets (Wikidata, GeoJSON) also lend credibility and traceability to any slide using them.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
