Here's a summary of the distinct types of images:\n\n1. **Thematic Map of Public Libraries**:\n   - A map that visually represents the geographic distribution of public library branches in the Netherlands. This map features various provinces, with markers indicating library locations, primarily clustered in urban areas such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague. The map illustrates a clean cartographic style with a light beige background (Reference ID: 1).\n\n2. **Geographic Map with Library Distribution**:\n   - Another map visualizes the spatial distribution of public libraries, specifically illustrating higher library density in the western provinces compared to rural areas. This map also uses small circular markers to represent library locations across the country (Reference ID: 1).\n\n3. **Scatter Plot on a Map**:\n   - A map designed as a scatter plot showing public library locations marked by geographic coordinates. The visual style is minimalist, focusing on higher concentrations in urban regions and lower densities in rural areas (Reference ID: 1).\n\n4. **Interactive Map of Library Locations**:\n   - This image depicts a static view of an interactive map centered on major cities in the Netherlands, showing the locations of public libraries. It provides a visual overview of library accessibility and serves educational purposes (Reference ID: 1).\n\n5. **Map with Postal Code Zones**:\n   - A thematic map that displays public library branches layered by postal code zones, color-coded to show different areas. This map helps to analyze library distribution in relation to postal codes, emphasizing urban centers versus rural regions (Reference ID: 1).\n\nThese images showcase key features of public library accessibility in the Netherlands and are styled consistently with cartographic standards used for mapping data in educational and administrative contexts. \n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",

      "raw_result": "To illustrate examples of distinct locations of public libraries in the Netherlands, various geospatial visualizations can be utilized. Here are some descriptions of these images:\n\n### Examples of Location Images of Public Libraries in the Netherlands\n\n1. **Geographic Distribution Map:**\n   - A thematic map displaying the geographic distribution of public library branches across the Netherlands. This map uses various pastel colors to denote different provinces, with small markers indicating the locations of library branches, particularly concentrated in urban areas like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. The absence of detailed text labels suggests the focus is on broad spatial analysis rather than specific identification of libraries.\n   - **Reference:** Image Path: `/auto/images/a4deb78b185cc230a1dfb5c79dc55cddf0bf337b6e150aac826a074710957952.jpg`\n\n2. **Scatter Plot Map:**\n   - A scatter plot visualizing the distribution of public libraries with small blue circles representing individual libraries. The map emphasizes higher library density in the western regions, particularly near major cities, providing a clear visual of geographic accessibility.\n   - **Reference:** Image Path: `/auto/images/7051817cfa15736fb1ad7ec037d5217842f57893eb3c75c2334297a80245a530.jpg`\n\n3. **Thematic Postal Code Map:**\n   - A color-coded map representing public library branches segmented by postal code zones. Each zone is defined with a unique color, highlighting the differences in library distribution across areas, especially reflecting urban versus rural disparities.\n   - **Reference:** Image Path: `/auto/images/c1391a0695f896445f39417bdb6f80a6be03bc0341b562966abff5e40b665566.jpg`\n\n4. **Clustering Map:**\n   - A clustered map showing library locations with a focus on urban density. Markers are grouped to indicate higher concentrations of libraries in areas such as the Randstad, confirming urban infrastructures' role in supporting library access.\n   - **Reference:** Image Path: `/auto/images/36586a5e19dd3e45a41618961280095ff47e87f604fd2f690e040eec12230169.jpg`\n\n5. **Basic Embedded Map:**\n   - A minimalist design map featuring library locations marked by standardized circular markers. The map fundamentally shows the entire Netherlands, supporting a regional overview of library accessibility across varying landscapes.\n   - **Reference:** Image Path: `/auto/images/01e0877770f8eda754ca3e233551f1075ea6056da94e6e6a6efc83a821a625a3.jpg`\n\nThese images can effectively communicate the accessibility and distribution of public libraries across different parts of the Netherlands, emphasizing the visual diversity of library locations.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
