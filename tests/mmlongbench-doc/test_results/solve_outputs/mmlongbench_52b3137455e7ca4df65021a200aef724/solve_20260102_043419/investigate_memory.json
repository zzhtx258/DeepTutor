Page 47 is referenced in the context only in relation to an image depicting a layered geographic map interface with color-coded data layers (population density, GDP per capita, internet penetration) and a legend panel, but there is no mention of an orange box or any SPARQL/Wikidata Query Service code being displayed on that page.\n\nAdditionally, while multiple images from the same document show WDQS interfaces with SPARQL code (e.g., on pages 11, 26, 28, and 53), none of these are associated with Page 47 or an orange box. The color orange appears in other contexts — such as orange markers for libraries on maps — but not as a box or UI element containing code on Page 47.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there is no evidence supporting the existence of an orange box with WDQS code on Page 47.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",

      "raw_result": "The provided context does not contain any explicit reference to an \"orange box\" associated with the Wikidata Query Service (WDQS) code interface. While multiple images depict the WDQS interface — including SPARQL query editors, map visualizations, and result panels — none describe or illustrate an orange-colored box within the code editor or UI elements. The interface is consistently described as having a dark theme with monospaced font, syntax highlighting in blue and green for keywords and variables, and a light gray background. Markers on maps are sometimes orange (e.g., for library icons or points), but these are geographic visualizations, not UI components of the code editor itself.\n\nTherefore, there is no evidence in the context to support the existence or appearance of an \"orange box\" in the Wikidata Query Service code interface.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
