      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of the Orange Box on Page 47\n\nThe objective is to determine whether an orange box containing Wikidata Query Service (WDQS) code exists on page 47 of the referenced document. Based on the available evidence, no such orange box is present.\n\nPage 47 is described as depicting a layered geographic map interface, featuring color-coded data layers (e.g., population density, GDP per capita) and a corresponding legend for visual interpretation [rag-1]. This visual content is entirely cartographic in nature and does not include any code editor, query interface, or UI element labeled or colored orange. Furthermore, the Wikidata Query Service interface itself — as documented in the context — is consistently characterized by a dark theme, monospaced font, and syntax-highlighted SPARQL code blocks, with no reference to orange-colored UI components in any of its known configurations [rag-2].\n\nAlthough WDQS SPARQL code examples are documented on other pages (specifically pages 11, 26, 28, and 53), none of these instances are associated with page 47, nor do they involve an orange box [rag-1]. The absence of any textual, visual, or contextual evidence supporting the existence of an orange box on this page leads to a definitive conclusion: **there is no orange box on page 47 that provides or links to WDQS code**.\n\nNo images or tool outputs corroborate the presence of such an element, and all available materials consistently confirm the absence of both the orange UI feature and any associated query code on this specific page.\n\n**Summary**: Page 47 contains a geographic map visualization with no UI elements related to WDQS code, and no orange box is present or referenced in any credible source.",
