From the analysis, the two files with the smallest sizes are:\n\n1. **UniversalBot.ipynb**: 555 bytes\n2. **VariousTests.ipynb**: 8,704 bytes\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of these two file sizes:\n\n$$\n\\text{Sum} = 555 \\text{ bytes} + 8,704 \\text{ bytes} = 9,259 \\text{ bytes}\n$$\n\nThus, the total size of the two files with the smallest sizes is **9,259 bytes**. This calculation confirms that we have accurately identified the smallest files and computed their combined size correctly. \n\nIn summary, the two files identified are 'UniversalBot.ipynb' and 'VariousTests.ipynb', and their total size amounts to 9,259 bytes.",

The execution was efficient, completing in approximately 40.38 milliseconds without any errors or output messages.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum of the sizes of the two files with the smallest sizes, 'UniversalBot.ipynb' and 'VariousTests.ipynb', is **9,259 bytes**.
