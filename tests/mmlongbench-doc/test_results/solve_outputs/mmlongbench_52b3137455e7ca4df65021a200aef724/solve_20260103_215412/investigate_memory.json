The structure consists of three columns: \"File Name,\" \"File Size,\" and \"Date.\" \n\nKey details include:\n\n- The directory entries, represented by names ending in '/', do not have file sizes listed.\n- Noteworthy files mentioned in the table include:\n  - **'DutchPublicLibraries_OpenStreetMap.ipynb'** with a file size of **442,444 bytes**, indicating extensive data processing related to Dutch public library geospatial data.\n  - **'DutchPublicLibraries_GoogleMaps_Test.ipynb'** with **18,132 bytes**, which appears to be a supplementary test file.\n  - **Other files** like **'UniversalBot.ipynb'** (555 bytes) and **'VariousTests.ipynb'** (8,704 bytes).\n\nThe table illustrates the utilization of Jupyter notebook files for data science tasks linked to public library datasets and geospatial analyses, reinforcing the context's emphasis on tools developed for GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) contributors.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
