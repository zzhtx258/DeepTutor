Mali’s land area falls within this range, resulting in the use of #6A5ACD for both its fill and stroke in the map visualization.\n\nThe color coding is derived from the SPARQL BIND logic that maps land area (P2046) to specific hex color values, and Mali’s entry in the table output explicitly lists #6A5ACD for both the fill and stroke fields.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
