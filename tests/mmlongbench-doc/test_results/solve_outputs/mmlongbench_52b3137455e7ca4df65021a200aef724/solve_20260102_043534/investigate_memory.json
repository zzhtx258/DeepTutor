      "raw_result": "In the GeoShapes SPARQL and OpenStreetMap (OSM) demonstration map visualizing African countries color-coded by land area, Mali is assigned a fill and stroke color of **#6A5ACD**, which is a shade of royal purple.\n\nThis color corresponds to countries with a land area between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 km², as defined by the nested IF conditions in the SPARQL query. Mali’s land area falls within this range, resulting in the use of #6A5ACD for both its fill and stroke in the map visualization.\n\nThe color coding is derived from the SPARQL BIND logic that maps land area (P2046) to specific hex color values, and Mali’s entry in the table output explicitly lists #6A5ACD for both the fill and stroke fields.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
