      "step_response": "## S1: Identify the Color Coding Rule for Mali in the GeoShapes SPARQL and OSM Demonstration Map\n\nIn the GeoShapes SPARQL and OpenStreetMap (OSM) demonstration map, countries are visualized using a color scheme that correlates with their land area ranges, enabling intuitive geographic comparison [rag-1]. For Mali, the assigned color is **#6A5ACD**, a shade known as royal purple, which is explicitly linked to countries whose land area falls within the range of **1,000,000 to 1,500,000 km²** [rag-1]. \n\nThis color mapping is not arbitrary; it follows a predefined gradient scale where distinct intervals of land area correspond to specific hex color codes. Mali’s land area, approximately 1,240,192 km², lies squarely within this interval, justifying its representation in #6A5ACD [rag-1]. The same color is applied to both the fill and stroke of Mali’s polygon on the map, ensuring visual consistency and clarity in the choropleth representation.\n\nThe use of #6A5ACD for this area range allows viewers to quickly associate Mali with other nations of similar size, such as Niger or Chad, which are also mapped under the same color band. This systematic encoding is a core feature of the GeoShapes SPARQL query system, which retrieves and renders geographic data from OSM with semantic styling rules based on attribute thresholds.\n\n### Summary\nMali is color-coded in royal purple (#6A5ACD) on the GeoShapes SPARQL and OSM demonstration map because its land area of ~1.24 million km² falls within the 1,000,000–1,500,000 km² range, as defined by the visualization’s color-scale mapping [rag-1].",
