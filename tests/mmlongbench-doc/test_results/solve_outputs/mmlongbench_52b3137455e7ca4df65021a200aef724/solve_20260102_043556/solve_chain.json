      "step_response": "## S1: Identify the Jupyter Notebook for Interactive Map Creation in Module 3\n\nModule 3 of the workshop “From Wikidata to Interactive Off-Wiki Maps in Three Steps” employs the Jupyter Notebook titled **`WikidataMapMakingWorkshop.ipynb`** to demonstrate the end-to-end process of creating an interactive map [rag-1]. This notebook serves as the primary instructional tool, guiding learners through a structured workflow that begins with querying georeferenced data from Wikidata using SPARQL, followed by data processing with `pandas` and `geopandas`, and culminating in interactive visualization using the `ipyleaflet` library [rag-1].\n\nThe notebook specifically extracts information about public libraries in the Netherlands, including their geographic coordinates, and renders them as point markers on a map. Notably, it implements cluster markers to manage visual density in areas with multiple libraries, enhancing usability and interpretability. The map is centered on Bergen, North Holland, with a distinct red marker identifying the Schoorl public library at coordinates ($52.08, 5.33$) [rag-1]. Additionally, the workflow generates a standalone HTML output, `NetherlandsPublicLibrariesHeatmap.html`, which provides a heatmap representation of library density across Dutch municipalities, further extending the analytical utility of the notebook [rag-1].\n\nThe choice of `ipyleaflet`—a Python interface to the Leaflet JavaScript library—enables dynamic, browser-based interactivity directly within the Jupyter environment, making it ideal for educational and exploratory data analysis tasks [rag-1]. This notebook thus exemplifies how open data from Wikidata can be transformed into geospatial insights using standard Python data science tools.\n\nIn summary, the `WikidataMapMakingWorkshop.ipynb` notebook is the designated example in Module 3 for teaching interactive map creation, integrating data retrieval, processing, and visualization into a single, reproducible workflow.",
