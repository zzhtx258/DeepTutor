      "raw_result": "Module 3 of the workshop “From Wikidata to Interactive Off-Wiki Maps in Three Steps” provides a practical example of creating an interactive map using a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Wikidata via SPARQL queries and Python libraries such as `pandas`, `geopandas`, and `folium` or `ipyleaflet`. The central example is the notebook titled **`WikidataMapMakingWorkshop.ipynb`**, which is publicly available on the PAWS (Python Analysis Workstation) server at https://paws-public.wmflabs.org.\n\nThe notebook demonstrates how to extract georeferenced data about public libraries in the Netherlands from Wikidata using a SPARQL query. This data is processed into a GeoDataFrame and then visualized as an interactive map rendered directly within the notebook environment. The resulting map features point markers for individual library locations, with cluster markers indicating areas of higher density, and is displayed using a Leaflet-style interface with zoom and layer controls.\n\nOne specific output from this notebook is a map centered on Bergen, North Holland, with a red marker labeled **“Schoorl public library”** at coordinates (52.08, 5.33), generated using the `ipyleaflet` library. The map is embedded in a Jupyter cell with a defined layout (900px width, 1000px height) and a black border, consistent with the notebook’s clean, educational design. The underlying code includes configuration of the map center, zoom level, and base layer (OpenStreetMap), followed by rendering the map object with `m = Map(...)`.\n\nThe final product of this workflow is an exported standalone HTML file named **`NetherlandsPublicLibrariesHeatmap.html`**, which can be viewed in any web browser without requiring access to Wikidata or Jupyter. This HTML file displays a heatmap overlay of library density across Dutch municipalities, using a color gradient from light green (low density) to red (high density), with a legend indicating counts up to 20+ libraries per municipality.\n\nThis entire process—from querying Wikidata, processing data in Python, generating an interactive map in Jupyter, to exporting a self-contained web map—illustrates the core objective of Module 3: building fully independent, off-Wiki geospatial visualizations that do not rely on Wikipedia or Wikimedia infrastructure.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] 52b3137455e7ca4df65021a200aef724.pdf",
