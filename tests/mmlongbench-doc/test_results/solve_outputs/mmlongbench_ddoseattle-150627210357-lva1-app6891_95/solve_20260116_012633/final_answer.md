## Detailed Answer

## S1: Clarifying the Cartoon’s Central Symbol — It’s a Hippopotamus, Not an Elephant

The cartoon referenced on page 25 does not feature an elephant at all. Instead, it prominently depicts a **hippopotamus**, which serves as a satirical symbol for hierarchical authority — specifically, the concept known as the “Highest Paid Person’s Opinion” (HiPPO) [rag-1]. This term refers to situations in organizational decision-making where the opinion of the highest-ranking or highest-paid individual overrides data, evidence, or collective input — even when that opinion is not supported by facts.

In the cartoon, the hippopotamus is shown declaring “OPTION B IT IS,” despite visible data supporting both Option A and Option B. This visual punchline underscores the absurdity of deferring to authority rather than logic or evidence — a common critique in data-driven cultures and agile methodologies [rag-1].

It is important to correct the initial assumption about an “elephant” — no such animal appears in the cartoon. The confusion may stem from the colloquial phrase “elephant in the room,” which refers to an obvious problem being ignored. However, in this specific context, the symbolic animal is unequivocally a hippopotamus, chosen for its imposing physical presence and metaphorical weight in organizational dynamics.

### Summary
The cartoon on page 25 features a hippopotamus — not an elephant — representing the HiPPO phenomenon: decisions dictated by rank rather than reason. This misidentification should be corrected to ensure accurate interpretation of the satire.
