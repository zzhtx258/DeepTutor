## S1: Symbolic Interpretation of the Hippo in the Cartoon on Page 25

In the cartoon titled *“Cartoon on Data-Driven Decision Making vs. Authority Bias”* on page 25, the hippopotamus serves as a powerful visual metaphor for the **Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO)** — a term used to describe organizational decision-making that prioritizes the views of senior leadership over empirical data or collective analysis [rag-1].

The hippo is depicted wearing a white collared shirt and assertively declaring, “OPTION B IT IS,” thereby overriding data visualizations that support both Option A and Option B. This imagery satirizes how authority figures — often those with the highest salary or rank — can unilaterally dismiss evidence-based recommendations in favor of their own subjective judgment. The cartoon critiques cultures where hierarchy supersedes reason, highlighting the risks of allowing positional power to eclipse analytical rigor.

This symbolic representation underscores a broader organizational challenge: the tension between data-driven governance and authority bias. By personifying HiPPO as a large, imposing hippopotamus, the cartoon visually reinforces the disproportionate influence such individuals wield — even when their decisions lack evidentiary support.

In summary, the hippo does not merely represent an individual but embodies a systemic issue: the tendency of organizations to defer to authority rather than evidence, often at the cost of optimal outcomes.
