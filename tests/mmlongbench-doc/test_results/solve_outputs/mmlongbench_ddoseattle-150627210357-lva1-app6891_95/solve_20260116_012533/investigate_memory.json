      "raw_result": "In the cartoon on page 25 — titled *“Cartoon on Data-Driven Decision Making vs. Authority Bias”* — the **hippopotamus** symbolizes the **Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO)**, a term used to describe decision-making dominated by hierarchical authority rather than evidence or data.\n\nThe hippo is depicted wearing a white collared shirt and declaring **“OPTION B IT IS,”** despite the presence of data visualizations on the whiteboard supporting both Option A and Option B. This exaggerated portrayal highlights how senior leadership — often represented by the “highest paid person” — can override collective analysis or dissent, even when data suggests otherwise.\n\nThe setting — a corporate meeting room with four attendees observing — reinforces the critique of organizational culture where rank trumps reason. The hippo’s absurdity underscores the satire: decisions should be driven by data, not by the loudest or most senior voice in the room.\n\nThis visual metaphor aligns with broader themes in the surrounding text advocating for a true *data-driven culture*, where decisions are informed by facts, testing, and collaboration — not hierarchy.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Cartoon on Data-Driven Decision Making vs. Authority Bias (image)\n- [2] Hippopotamus\n- [3] HiPPO\n- [4] Corporate Meeting Room\n- [5] Blue Banner",
      "summary": "In the cartoon on page 25 titled 'Cartoon on Data-Driven Decision Making vs. Authority Bias,' the hippopotamus represents the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO) — a metaphor for decision-making dominated by hierarchical authority rather than data or evidence. The hippo, wearing a white collared shirt and declaring 'OPTION B IT IS,' overrides data visualizations supporting both options, satirizing how senior leadership can dismiss collective analysis in favor of their own opinion. The scene critiques organizational cultures where rank trumps reason.",
