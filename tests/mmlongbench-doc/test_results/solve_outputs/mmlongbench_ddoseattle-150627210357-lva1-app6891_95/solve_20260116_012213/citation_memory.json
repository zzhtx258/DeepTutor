While the video itself is not explicitly described as showing “weak data leadership,” its inclusion serves as a real-world example of what can happen when data (in this case, GPS navigation) is trusted without critical human judgment or oversight — a scenario that can reflect underlying issues in data governance, leadership, or cultural adoption of data.\n\nIn broader context, such an incident underscores the need for strong data leadership — which includes ensuring data quality, promoting data literacy, and fostering a culture where data is used wisely rather than blindly. The video thus indirectly supports the argument that weak data leadership can lead to poor outcomes, even when technology (like GPS) is available.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] YouTube Video Link\n- [2] Girls Crash into Lake",
