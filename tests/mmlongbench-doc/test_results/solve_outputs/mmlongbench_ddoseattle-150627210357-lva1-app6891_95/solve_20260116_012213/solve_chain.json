While the video itself does not explicitly mention “weak data leadership,” it is used metaphorically in the slides to demonstrate how reliance on flawed or unverified data — without proper governance, literacy, or critical evaluation — can lead to serious negative outcomes [rag-1].\n\nThis example underscores the importance of strong data leadership, which includes ensuring data quality, fostering data literacy among users, and promoting wise, context-aware usage of data-driven tools.\n\n### Summary\nThe YouTube video referenced in the slides to illustrate the consequence of weak data leadership is **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8**, which shows a real-life incident where blind trust in GPS data led to a crash — serving as a cautionary tale for organizations relying on data without proper oversight.",
