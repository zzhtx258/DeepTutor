      "raw_result": "The referenced YouTube video is linked via the URL: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8**. \n\nThis video is mentioned in the context of illustrating consequences related to data-driven decision-making failures — specifically, it is associated with the event where girls crashed into a lake after following bad GPS directions. While the video itself is not explicitly described as showing “weak data leadership,” its inclusion serves as a real-world example of what can happen when data (in this case, GPS navigation) is trusted without critical human judgment or oversight — a scenario that can reflect underlying issues in data governance, leadership, or cultural adoption of data.\n\nIn broader context, such an incident underscores the need for strong data leadership — which includes ensuring data quality, promoting data literacy, and fostering a culture where data is used wisely rather than blindly. The video thus indirectly supports the argument that weak data leadership can lead to poor outcomes, even when technology (like GPS) is available.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] YouTube Video Link\n- [2] Girls Crash into Lake",
      "summary": "The slides reference a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8) that shows girls crashing into a lake after following incorrect GPS directions. While the video does not explicitly mention 'weak data leadership,' it is used as a real-world example to illustrate consequences of blindly trusting data without human oversight — highlighting the need for strong data leadership, including data quality, literacy, and wise usage.",
