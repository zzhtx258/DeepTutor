## Detailed Answer

## S1: Identification of the YouTube Video Illustrating Consequences of Weak Data Leadership

The slides reference a specific YouTube video to illustrate the real-world consequences that can arise from weak data leadership — particularly when decisions are made by blindly trusting data outputs without human oversight, contextual understanding, or quality validation. 

According to the provided knowledge, the referenced video is:

**[YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8)**

This video depicts an incident in which girls crashed into a lake after following incorrect GPS directions. While the video itself does not explicitly mention “weak data leadership,” it is used metaphorically in the slides to demonstrate how reliance on flawed or unverified data — without proper governance, literacy, or critical evaluation — can lead to serious negative outcomes [rag-1].

This example underscores the importance of strong data leadership, which includes ensuring data quality, fostering data literacy among users, and promoting wise, context-aware usage of data-driven tools.

### Summary
The YouTube video referenced in the slides to illustrate the consequence of weak data leadership is **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8**, which shows a real-life incident where blind trust in GPS data led to a crash — serving as a cautionary tale for organizations relying on data without proper oversight.
