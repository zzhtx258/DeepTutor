## S1: Key Business Cooperation Activities in the Levels of Analytics Framework

The Levels of Analytics framework delineates four essential business cooperation activities that organizations can utilize to enhance their decision-making processes and collaborative efforts across various functions. These activities are as follows:

1. **Standard Reports**: This foundational level focuses on generating reports that provide insights into historical data. These reports are crucial for understanding past performance and trends, serving as a baseline for further analysis.

2. **Ad-hoc Reports and Query Drilldown (OLAP)**: This level allows users to create customized reports and perform in-depth data exploration. Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) enables users to drill down into data, facilitating a more granular understanding of specific metrics and trends.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: At this level, organizations employ statistical methods to identify underlying causes and relationships within the data. This analysis helps in uncovering patterns that may not be immediately apparent, thus informing strategic decisions.

4. **Forecasting and Predictive Modelling**: The highest level of analytics focuses on predicting future outcomes and trends based on historical data. This proactive approach enables businesses to anticipate changes in the market and adjust their strategies accordingly.

These four activities collectively enhance the analytical capabilities of organizations, fostering better cooperation and informed decision-making across business functions, thereby driving overall performance and efficiency in operations.
