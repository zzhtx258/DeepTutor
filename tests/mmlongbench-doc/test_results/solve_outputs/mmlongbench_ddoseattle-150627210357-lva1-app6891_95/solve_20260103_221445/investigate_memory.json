      "raw_result": "The Levels of Analytics framework outlines a hierarchy of analytical capabilities that organizations can leverage to enhance their business cooperation activities. Here are the four key levels of analytics presented within this structure:\n\n1. **Standard Reports**: This foundational level deals with historical data, mainly answering the question, \"What happened?\" Standard Reports provide insights into past performance and trends, enabling businesses to understand their operations at a basic level.\n\n2. **Ad-hoc Reports and Query Drilldown (OLAP)**: At this level, organizations can explore data more deeply to answer, \"Where exactly is the problem?\" Ad-hoc reports allow users to generate customized reports on demand, while Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) enables drill-down capabilities to analyze specific data segments.\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: This level addresses the question, \"Why is this happening?\" Statistical analysis uses advanced techniques to identify underlying causes and relationships in the data, providing insights that inform decision-making.\n\n4. **Forecasting and Predictive Modelling**: These advanced levels focus on predicting future outcomes. Forecasting answers, \"What if these trends continue?\" while predictive modelling anticipates future events, addressing \"What will happen next?\" Both methodologies are crucial for strategic planning and risk management.\n\nTogether, these levels facilitate a progressive approach to data analysis, enhancing cooperation and decision-making across business functions by transitioning from basic reporting to actionable insights and strategic foresight.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] ddoseattle-150627210357-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
      "summary": "The Levels of Analytics framework identifies four key business cooperation activities: 1. Standard Reports, which provide insights into historical data; 2. Ad-hoc Reports and Query Drilldown (OLAP), allowing deeper exploration of data; 3. Statistical Analysis, which identifies underlying causes and relationships in data; and 4. Forecasting and Predictive Modelling, which focus on predicting future outcomes and trends. These levels enhance decision-making and cooperation across business functions.",
