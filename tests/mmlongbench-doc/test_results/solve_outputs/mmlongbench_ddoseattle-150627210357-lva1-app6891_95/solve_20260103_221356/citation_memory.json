      "raw_result": "The four business analytics activities related to the levels of analytics can be encapsulated in a hierarchical framework that illustrates the progression from basic reporting to advanced strategic understanding. This framework consists of the following levels:\n\n1. **Standard Reports**: \n   - This foundational level answers the question “What happened?” and provides routine, historical reporting. It is primarily descriptive, focusing on past performance using simple aggregate data.\n\n2. **Ad-hoc Reports & Query Drilldown (OLAP)**: \n   - At this level, analysts seek to understand “Where exactly is the problem?” through deeper exploration of data. It allows for more flexibility in querying data but still remains largely reactive.\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: \n   - Here, the focus shifts to understanding the reasons behind trends, answering “Why is this happening?” This level employs statistical tools and methods to analyze past data and derive insights.\n\n4. **Forecasting and Predictive Modelling**: \n   - Advancing further, this level tackles the question \"What will happen next?\" by predicting outcomes based on historical data and trends. This strategy helps organizations anticipate future scenarios and make informed decisions.\n\n5. **Optimisation and Business Intelligence**: \n   - This apex level seeks to identify “What’s the best that can happen?” and represents a strategic goal of analytics. It focuses on achieving optimal results and actionable intelligence for better decision-making.\n\nThis hierarchy illustrates how organizations can evolve from simple descriptive reporting to sophisticated analytical capabilities that inform strategic actions and improve business outcomes. \n\n### References\n\n- [1] ddoseattle-150627210357-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
