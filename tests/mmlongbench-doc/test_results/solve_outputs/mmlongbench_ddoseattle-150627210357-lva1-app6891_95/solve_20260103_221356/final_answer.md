## S1: Analysis of the Four Business Analytics Activities

In the context of business analytics, there are four key activities that correspond to different levels of analytics. These activities are structured in a hierarchical framework, illustrating the progression from basic reporting to advanced predictive analysis. The four activities are as follows:

1. **Standard Reports**: This foundational level of analytics addresses the question, "What happened?" Standard reports provide historical data and insights, allowing businesses to assess past performance and outcomes. These reports are typically generated regularly and serve as a basis for understanding overall trends and metrics within an organization.

2. **Ad-hoc Reports & Query Drilldown (OLAP)**: At this level, the focus shifts to identifying specific issues, answering the question, "Where exactly is the problem?" Ad-hoc reporting enables users to create customized reports on demand, while Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) allows for deeper exploration of data. This activity facilitates a more granular analysis, helping analysts pinpoint anomalies or areas requiring attention.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: This activity delves deeper into the data to address the question, "Why is this happening?" Statistical analysis involves using various techniques to identify trends, correlations, and patterns within the data. By applying statistical methods, businesses can gain insights into the underlying factors driving performance and behavior, which is crucial for informed decision-making.

4. **Forecasting and Predictive Modelling**: The most advanced level of analytics focuses on predicting future outcomes, answering the question, "What will happen next?" This involves utilizing historical data to create models that forecast future trends and behaviors. Predictive analytics leverages statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide actionable insights that can guide strategic planning and resource allocation.

These four activities collectively enhance an organization's ability to analyze data and derive meaningful insights, ultimately supporting better decision-making and strategic initiatives in business operations.
