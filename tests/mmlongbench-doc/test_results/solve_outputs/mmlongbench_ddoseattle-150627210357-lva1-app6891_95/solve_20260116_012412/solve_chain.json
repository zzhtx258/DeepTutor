      "step_response": "## S1: Traits of a Data-Driven Person\n\nAccording to the conceptual framework presented in the slides, a data-driven person is not defined by mere access to tools or dashboards, but rather by a constellation of mindsets, skills, and behaviors that enable them to transform raw data into actionable insights and measurable business value [rag-1]. These traits collectively form the foundation for effective data utilization in decision-making and strategic execution.\n\nThe following are the key attributes a data-driven person possesses:\n\n1. **Testing Mindset** — A willingness to experiment, validate hypotheses, and iterate based on empirical evidence.\n2. **Fact-Based Decision-Making Skills** — The ability to prioritize objective data over intuition or anecdotal evidence when making choices.\n3. **Data Literacy** — Competence in understanding, interpreting, and working with data across formats and sources.\n4. **Storytelling Ability** — The skill to communicate data insights compellingly and contextually to diverse audiences.\n5. **Goals-First Orientation** — Aligning data analysis with clear business objectives and outcomes.\n6. **Self-Service Capability** — Empowerment to independently access, analyze, and visualize data without constant reliance on IT or analytics teams.\n7. **Inquisitive and Objective Culture** — A mindset that values curiosity, critical thinking, and neutrality in exploring data.\n8. **Understanding of the Analytics Value Chain** — Awareness of how data flows from collection to insight to action within an organization.\n9. **Ability to Demonstrate Value** — Translating analytical outputs into tangible business impact or ROI.\n10. **Collaborative Sharing Attitude** — Willingness to share findings, tools, and knowledge across teams to foster organizational learning.\n\nThese traits go beyond technical proficiency; they reflect a holistic approach to leveraging data as a strategic asset. A truly data-driven individual integrates these capabilities to drive innovation, efficiency, and informed leadership.\n\nThis list is derived directly from the conceptual framework provided in the slides, which emphasizes behavioral and cultural competencies over tool-centric definitions [rag-1].",
