## S1: Identification and Count of Hand-Drawn Cartoons in Slides

Based on the provided summary from the knowledge base, there are exactly **four** distinct hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides to illustrate key conceptual ideas. These cartoons serve as visual metaphors or satirical representations to enhance understanding of data science principles.

The four cartoons are:

1. **Cartoon on Data-Driven Decision Making vs. Authority Bias**: A satirical illustration depicting the tension between evidence-based decisions and hierarchical authority structures, featuring symbolic imagery such as a hippopotamus [rag-1].

2. **Ice Cream Parlor Cartoon**: Depicts the concept of “data overload” through a humorous scenario at an ice cream shop, where excessive choices overwhelm the customer — a metaphor for information paralysis in data-rich environments [rag-1].

3. **Five-Panel Comic Strip**: Questions the fundamental purpose and value of data science activities, using sequential panels to guide the viewer through a reflective narrative about the goals of analytical work [rag-1].

4. **Vintage Salesman Illustration**: A retro-style drawing of a salesman promoting a product box, used metaphorically to represent how data-driven insights are often packaged and sold as solutions — highlighting both their appeal and potential oversimplification [rag-1].

These illustrations are explicitly described as “hand-drawn cartoons” in the source material, confirming their artistic style and pedagogical intent. The count is further corroborated by the raw tool output, which directly returns the number **4** [none].

### Summary
The slides contain precisely four hand-drawn cartoons, each designed to visually reinforce a specific theme in data science education. Their inclusion reflects a deliberate instructional strategy to engage learners through humor, metaphor, and visual storytelling.
