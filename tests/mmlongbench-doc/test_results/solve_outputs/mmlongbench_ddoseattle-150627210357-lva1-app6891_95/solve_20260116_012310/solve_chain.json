      "step_response": "## S1: Identification and Count of Hand-Drawn Cartoons in Slides\n\nBased on the provided summary from the knowledge base, there are exactly **four** distinct hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides to illustrate key conceptual ideas. These cartoons serve as visual metaphors or satirical representations to enhance understanding of data science principles.\n\nThe four cartoons are:\n\n1. **Cartoon on Data-Driven Decision Making vs. Authority Bias**: A satirical illustration depicting the tension between evidence-based decisions and hierarchical authority structures, featuring symbolic imagery such as a hippopotamus [rag-1].\n\n2. **Ice Cream Parlor Cartoon**: Depicts the concept of “data overload” through a humorous scenario at an ice cream shop, where excessive choices overwhelm the customer — a metaphor for information paralysis in data-rich environments [rag-1].\n\n3. **Five-Panel Comic Strip**: Questions the fundamental purpose and value of data science activities, using sequential panels to guide the viewer through a reflective narrative about the goals of analytical work [rag-1].\n\n4. **Vintage Salesman Illustration**: A retro-style drawing of a salesman promoting a product box, used metaphorically to represent how data-driven insights are often packaged and sold as solutions — highlighting both their appeal and potential oversimplification [rag-1].\n\nThese illustrations are explicitly described as “hand-drawn cartoons” in the source material, confirming their artistic style and pedagogical intent. The count is further corroborated by the raw tool output, which directly returns the number **4** [none].\n\n### Summary\nThe slides contain precisely four hand-drawn cartoons, each designed to visually reinforce a specific theme in data science education. Their inclusion reflects a deliberate instructional strategy to engage learners through humor, metaphor, and visual storytelling.",
