      "step_response": "## S1: Verification of Cartoon and Elephant Symbolism on Page 25\n\nThe user’s query asks whether an elephant is depicted in a cartoon on page 25 and what it represents. To address this, we must first determine whether such a cartoon exists in the provided materials.\n\nAccording to the available knowledge base and raw excerpts, page 25 contains a digital dashboard featuring a Sankey diagram that visualizes data flows between organizational departments—specifically Sales, Marketing, and Operations [rag-1]. The description explicitly states that the content is analytical and data-oriented, with no reference to cartoon imagery, anthropomorphic elements, or symbolic representations such as an elephant. Furthermore, there is no indication of any illustrative, metaphorical, or satirical visual style that would qualify as a “cartoon” in the traditional sense.\n\nSince no cartoon exists on page 25, the question of what the elephant represents is predicated on a non-existent visual element. Symbolic interpretations—such as the common cultural association of elephants with “the elephant in the room” or organizational blind spots—cannot be applied here, as the visual medium required for such symbolism is absent.\n\nNo images were generated or provided that contradict this finding, and all tool execution results confirm the absence of cartoon elements on this page.\n\nIn summary, there is no cartoon on page 25, and therefore no elephant to interpret. The content is strictly a data visualization dashboard, devoid of symbolic or illustrative cartoon features.",
