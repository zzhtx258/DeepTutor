      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of the Existence and Content of the \"Levels of Analytics\" Chart\n\nThe chart titled **“Levels of Analytics”** does not exist as a standalone visual or tabular artifact in the provided materials. Multiple search queries across the knowledge base confirm that no such chart with explicit labels, numerical values, or four defined business analytics activities is present [rag-1][rag-2][rag-6]. The term “Levels of Analytics” is referenced only as a conceptual framework describing a hierarchy of analytical maturity — progressing from basic descriptive reporting to advanced prescriptive modeling — but it does not formalize a fixed set of four stages or activities [rag-4].\n\nHowever, the concept is closely associated with two core business analytics activities:\n- **Reporting**, which corresponds to *Descriptive Analytics* and answers the question: *“What happened?”*\n- **Analysis**, which corresponds to *Prescriptive Analytics* and answers: *“What should we do?”*  \n[cite: rag-4]\n\nWhile these two activities represent the foundational progression within the “Levels of Analytics” concept, they fall short of the requested four activities. The closest structured model mentioned in the materials is the **five-stage Analytics Value Chain**:  \n1. Data  \n2. Reporting  \n3. Analysis  \n4. Action  \n5. Value  \n[cite: rag-3][rag-5]\n\nThis five-stage model is explicitly described as a sequential process and may be used interchangeably in strategic discussions with the “Levels of Analytics” concept, though it is not identical to it. No official four-activity framework under the title “Levels of Analytics” is documented.\n\nIn summary, while the user’s query references a specific chart with four business analytics activities, the available materials do not contain such a chart or list. The concept of “Levels of Analytics” is limited to two core activities (Reporting and Analysis), and any attempt to derive four activities would require inference or adaptation from related models like the Analytics Value Chain — which itself contains five stages. Therefore, the exact answer to the user’s question — based strictly on available evidence — cannot be fulfilled as stated.",
