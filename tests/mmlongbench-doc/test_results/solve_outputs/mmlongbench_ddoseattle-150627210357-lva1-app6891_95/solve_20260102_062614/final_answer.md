## S1: Identify the Four Business Analytics Activities from the Levels of Analytics Framework

The Levels of Analytics framework organizes business analytics into a progressive hierarchy that reflects increasing sophistication in data-driven decision-making. According to the provided knowledge, the four core business analytics activities are:

1. **Standard Reports** – This foundational activity describes *what happened* by summarizing historical data through dashboards, KPIs, and routine reports. It provides a retrospective view of business performance [rag-1].  
2. **Statistical Analysis** – This level seeks to *explain why* something happened by applying statistical techniques such as correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing to uncover patterns and relationships within the data [rag-1].  
3. **Predictive Modelling** – At this stage, analytical models (e.g., machine learning, time series forecasting) are used to *forecast what will happen* based on historical trends and current conditions, enabling proactive planning [rag-1].  
4. **Optimisation** – The most advanced activity, optimisation *recommends the best course of action* to achieve specific business objectives, often using algorithms to evaluate multiple scenarios and select the optimal outcome under constraints [rag-1].

These four activities form a logical progression—from descriptive to prescriptive analytics—each building upon the insights of the previous level. While the full framework may include additional capabilities, these four represent the essential pillars of business analytics practice as defined in the referenced material.

The absence of visual artifacts in this step confirms that the identification of these activities relies solely on textual knowledge, which is consistent with the clarity and structure of the provided definition.
