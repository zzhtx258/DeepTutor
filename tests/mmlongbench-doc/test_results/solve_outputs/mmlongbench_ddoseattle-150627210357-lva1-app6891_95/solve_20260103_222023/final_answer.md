## S1: Evaluation of Hand-Drawn Cartoons in Slides

In evaluating the available information regarding the number of hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides, it is clear that there is a lack of specific data on this topic. Multiple sources have confirmed that there is insufficient information to determine the exact number of hand-drawn cartoons present. 

The summaries from the knowledge base indicate a consistent message: 

- **Source [rag-1]** states, "There is insufficient information available to determine the number of hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides."
- **Source [rag-2]** reiterates, "I do not have enough information to answer that question."
- **Source [rag-3]** also confirms the absence of relevant details, stating, "There is insufficient information available to determine the number of hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides."

This repeated assertion across various sources indicates a consensus that no specific count or details regarding hand-drawn cartoons are available in the current context.

In conclusion, without further information or context regarding the slides in question, it is impossible to ascertain the number of hand-drawn cartoons included. Further inquiry or access to the slides themselves would be necessary to provide a definitive answer.
