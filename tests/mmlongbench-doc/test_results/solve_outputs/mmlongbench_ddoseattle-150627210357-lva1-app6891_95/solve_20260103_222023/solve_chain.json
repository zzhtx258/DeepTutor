Multiple sources have confirmed that there is insufficient information to determine the exact number of hand-drawn cartoons present. \n\nThe summaries from the knowledge base indicate a consistent message: \n\n- **Source [rag-1]** states, \"There is insufficient information available to determine the number of hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides.\"\n- **Source [rag-2]** reiterates, \"I do not have enough information to answer that question.\"\n- **Source [rag-3]** also confirms the absence of relevant details, stating, \"There is insufficient information available to determine the number of hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides.\"\n\nThis repeated assertion across various sources indicates a consensus that no specific count or details regarding hand-drawn cartoons are available in the current context.\n\nIn conclusion, without further information or context regarding the slides in question, it is impossible to ascertain the number of hand-drawn cartoons included.
