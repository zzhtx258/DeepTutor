      "raw_result": "The YouTube video referenced in the context to illustrate the consequence of blindly following data is linked to the incident where **girls crashed into a lake after following bad GPS directions**. This event serves as a real-world example of how over-reliance on data (in this case, GPS navigation) can lead to failure when human judgment or intuition is ignored.\n\nThe video is associated with the **YouTube Video Link** entity, which points to the URL:  \n**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8**\n\nThis video likely elaborates on the story or provides commentary on the dangers of uncritically trusting data systems without cross-checking or applying contextual awareness.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Girls Crash into Lake\n- [2] YouTube Video Link\n- [3] GPS",
