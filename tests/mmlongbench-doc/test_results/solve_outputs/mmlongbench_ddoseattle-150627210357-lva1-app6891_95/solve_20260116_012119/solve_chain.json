This video documents an incident in which **a group of girls crashed into a lake after following incorrect GPS directions** — a vivid example of how over-reliance on automated data systems can lead to serious consequences when contextual awareness and situational reasoning are ignored [rag-1].\n\nThe video is publicly available at the following URL:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2QlH2uz3p8)\n\nThis case serves as a cautionary tale in data literacy and decision-making, emphasizing that while data-driven tools (like GPS navigation) are powerful, they must be used in conjunction with human oversight and environmental awareness to avoid preventable errors.\n\n### Summary\nThe referenced YouTube video illustrates the peril of uncritical reliance on data through the real-life example of a GPS-guided crash into a lake. The video’s URL is provided for direct access and further study.",
