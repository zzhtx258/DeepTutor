## S1: Determining Use of YouTube Video to Illustrate Consequences of Blind Data Following

The question asks whether the slides employ a YouTube video to demonstrate the consequences of blindly following data. Based on the provided knowledge and tool execution results, the answer is unequivocally no.

According to the knowledge base, the slides do not reference or incorporate any YouTube video for this purpose [rag-1]. Instead, they rely on a static visual artifact—a photograph of a car submerged in a lake—as a concrete, illustrative example of the dangers of uncritical reliance on algorithmic guidance, such as GPS navigation systems [rag-1]. This image serves as a cautionary tale: the driver followed GPS instructions despite clear environmental contradictions (e.g., the road leading into water), highlighting the risk of surrendering human judgment to data-driven systems without verification.

The absence of any video reference is further corroborated by the tool execution results, which explicitly restate that “the slides do not use any YouTube video to illustrate the consequence of blindly following data” and reaffirm the use of the static lake image as the sole visual example [rag-1]. No supplementary video links, embedded media, or external streaming content are mentioned in any of the provided materials.

Since no image files are available for insertion and no video artifacts are referenced, there is no multimodal evidence to suggest otherwise. The pedagogical choice here is deliberate—using a single, high-impact static image to provoke reflection without the distraction or passivity that video might introduce.

In summary, the slides intentionally avoid YouTube or any dynamic media to emphasize the universality and immediacy of the lesson: even a simple, non-interactive image can powerfully convey the peril of blind data obedience.
