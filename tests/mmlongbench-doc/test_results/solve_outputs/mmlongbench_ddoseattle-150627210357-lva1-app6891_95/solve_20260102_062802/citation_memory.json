While several images are described in detail—such as the car submerged in a lake due to incorrect GPS directions (reference_id: 1)—these are static visual artifacts, not video content. The narrative around the GPS incident serves as a cautionary example of over-reliance on algorithmic guidance without human judgment, but no video source, including YouTube, is cited or implied in any of the document chunks.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available, there is no evidence of a YouTube video being used in the slides for this purpose.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] ddoseattle-150627210357-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
