      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of YouTube Video Usage in Slides to Illustrate Weak Data Leadership Consequences\n\nTo determine whether the slides explicitly reference or embed a YouTube video to illustrate the consequences of weak data leadership, we examine the provided knowledge base and tool execution results. The objective is not to assess the *nature* of the consequences themselves—such as Tesco’s $9.6B loss, the sale of Dunhumby, or Warren Buffett’s public admission of error—but rather to identify whether any *video content* was used as an illustrative medium within the slides [rag-1][rag-2].\n\nBoth [rag-1] and [rag-2] explicitly state that while textual and static case studies are employed to demonstrate the impact of weak data leadership, **no YouTube video is referenced, embedded, or cited in direct association with these examples**. Although a YouTube URL is mentioned elsewhere in the source document, it lacks contextual linkage to the topic of data leadership consequences, rendering it irrelevant for the purpose of slide illustration [rag-2].\n\nThe tool execution result corroborates this finding, confirming:  \n> *“The slides do not explicitly reference or embed a YouTube video to illustrate the consequences of weak data leadership. While a YouTube URL is mentioned in the document, it is not associated with illustrating this specific topic. The consequences are illustrated using static examples such as Tesco's $9.6B loss, the sale of Dunhumby, and Warren Buffett's admission of error.”*\n\nNo images or multimedia artifacts are provided or generated in this step, further supporting the conclusion that visual or dynamic media beyond static text and numerical examples were not utilized.\n\n### Summary  \nThere is no evidence that the slides use any YouTube video to illustrate the consequences of weak data leadership. All illustrative content is drawn from static, textual case studies, and any incidental mention of a YouTube link is unrelated to the topic at hand.",
