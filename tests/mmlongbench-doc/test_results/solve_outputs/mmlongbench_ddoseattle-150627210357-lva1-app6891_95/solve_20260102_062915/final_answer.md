## S1: Key Characteristics of a Data-Driven Person

A data-driven person is defined not merely by technical skill, but by a distinct constellation of behavioral, cognitive, and cultural traits that prioritize evidence over intuition in decision-making [rag-1]. Based on the provided materials, the seven core characteristics of a data-driven person are as follows:

1. **Numeracy**: The ability to work with, interpret, and reason with quantitative information. This goes beyond basic arithmetic to include understanding statistical distributions, trends, and the limitations of data [rag-1].

2. **Detail-Orientation**: A disciplined focus on accuracy, granularity, and consistency in data handling. Data-driven individuals pay close attention to anomalies, missing values, and measurement precision, recognizing that small errors can lead to large misinterpretations [rag-1].

3. **Skepticism**: A healthy, systematic doubt toward unverified claims. Rather than accepting assertions at face value, a data-driven person routinely asks, “What’s the evidence?” and validates assumptions through data inspection and cross-checking [rag-1].

4. **Communication Skills**: The capacity to translate complex analytical findings into clear, compelling, and actionable narratives tied to measurable business outcomes. This involves tailoring explanations for diverse audiences—from engineers to executives—ensuring insights drive decisions [rag-1].

5. **Business Acumen**: An understanding of how data connects to organizational goals, market dynamics, and operational efficiency. A data-driven person does not analyze in a vacuum; they align their work with strategic priorities to drive tangible change [rag-1].

6. **Collaboration in Self-Service Environments**: A preference for and effectiveness within ecosystems that break down data silos and empower cross-functional teams with access to tools and literacy. Such individuals foster a culture of shared ownership and broad data fluency, enabling decentralized yet coordinated analysis [rag-1].

7. **Testing Culture**: An orientation toward hypothesis-driven experimentation, particularly through methods like A/B testing. They view results—not as binary successes or failures—but as signals for learning. Surprises are welcomed as opportunities to refine models, challenge biases, and improve systems [rag-1].

These traits collectively form a mindset that treats data not as a tool, but as a foundational language for organizational reasoning and improvement [rag-1].

In summary, a data-driven person integrates analytical rigor with interpersonal and strategic capabilities, operating at the intersection of data, behavior, and organizational culture to enable evidence-based decision-making.

    A data-driven person is numerate, detail-oriented, and skeptical, routinely asking for data to back up claims and validating assumptions rather than relying on intuition or anecdotal evidence. They are confident communicators who translate complex analyses into actionable insights tied to measurable outcomes, and they operate with business acumen to drive change. They thrive in collaborative, self-service environments that reject data silos and promote broad data literacy across teams. They also operate within a testing culture, using experiments like A/B tests to generate and validate hypotheses, welcoming surprises as signals for improvement rather than failures.
