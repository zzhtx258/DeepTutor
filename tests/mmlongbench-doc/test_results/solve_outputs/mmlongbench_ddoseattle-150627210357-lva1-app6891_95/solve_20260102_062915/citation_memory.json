      "raw_result": "A data-driven person embodies a set of behavioral, cognitive, and cultural traits that enable them to make decisions grounded in evidence, not intuition. These characteristics are not limited to technical proficiency but extend to mindset, communication, and collaboration.\n\nAt the core, a data-driven person is **numerate, detail-oriented, and skeptical**. They approach problems with curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism, asking “Do you have data to back that up?” as a routine part of dialogue — a question no one fears to ask and everyone is prepared to answer. They do not accept surface-level metrics or anecdotal evidence; instead, they dig into the source, validate assumptions, and test hypotheses. This aligns with the emphasis on an **objective, inquisitive culture**, where decisions are anchored in fact-based analysis rather than the opinions of the highest-paid person (HiPPO).\n\nThey are also **confident communicators and business-savvy**. A data-driven individual understands that insight without action is invisible. They don’t just produce reports or dashboards — they connect actions to outcomes, using clear narratives to translate complex analyses into strategic decisions. Whether using an RCT, customer feedback, or SAS analytics, they tie their findings to measurable impacts, demonstrating value through frameworks like “Evidence shows that this action will lead to a better outcome.” Their goal is not to impress with data complexity, but to drive change.\n\nFurthermore, a data-driven person thrives in a **self-service and collaborative environment**. They have the autonomy to access and explore data relevant to their role, while also actively sharing insights across teams. They reject data silos and hoarding, recognizing that context is king — connecting disparate data sources to uncover deeper patterns. This is supported by a **broad data literacy** across the organization, where even non-analysts can interpret and use data meaningfully.\n\nFinally, they operate within a **testing culture**, constantly generating and validating hypotheses through experimentation — such as A/B tests — and iterating based on results. Surprises are welcomed as signals from the market, not failures. They understand that being data-driven does not mean blindly following numbers; it means augmenting judgment with trustworthy, relevant data to make better, faster decisions.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] ddoseattle-150627210357-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
