      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Chart Content — Does “Levels of Analytics” Reference Four Business Cooperation Activities?\n\nThe chart titled **“Levels of Analytics”** does not contain any reference to “four business cooperation activities.” Based on a comprehensive review of all available materials, including conceptual descriptions, knowledge graph references, and tool-generated summaries, the term *“Levels of Analytics”* refers exclusively to a hierarchical framework for analytical maturity — typically spanning from **descriptive analytics** (e.g., reporting “What happened?”) to **prescriptive analytics** (e.g., recommending “What should we do?”) [rag-4].\n\nNo visual chart, table, or labeled diagram by that title exists in the provided context that includes numerical data, discrete categories, or business cooperation activities [rag-1][rag-2]. Furthermore, explicit searches for “four business cooperation activities” within any chart or table related to *Levels of Analytics* or the *Analytics Paradigm Comparison Table* yielded no results [rag-3].\n\nThe concept is primarily used to contrast analytical paradigms — such as Reporting vs. Analysis — rather than to enumerate collaborative business functions. Therefore, the notion of “four business cooperation activities” appears to be either misattributed to this framework or derived from an external source not present in the current knowledge base.\n\n### Summary\nThere is no evidence in the available materials that the chart “Levels of Analytics” contains or references “four business cooperation activities.” The framework instead focuses on levels of analytical maturity and decision support, not cooperative business processes. Any claim linking these two concepts is unsupported by the current documentation.",
