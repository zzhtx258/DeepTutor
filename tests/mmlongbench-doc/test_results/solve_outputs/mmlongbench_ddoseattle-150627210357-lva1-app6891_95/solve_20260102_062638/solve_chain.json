      "step_response": "## S1: Evaluation of the 'Levels of Analytics' Chart for Business Cooperation Activities\n\nThe objective of this step is to determine whether the “Levels of Analytics” chart explicitly identifies four business cooperation activities. To address this, we analyze the available knowledge sources and tool execution results.\n\nAccording to all three retrieved knowledge base citations ([rag-1], [rag-2], [rag-3]), the “Levels of Analytics” chart does not describe business cooperation activities at all. Instead, it presents a seven-layer hierarchical pyramid that outlines **analytical capabilities** progressing from foundational to advanced stages—such as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics—representing an organization’s analytical maturity [rag-1]. These layers are focused on the *type of insight* generated by data, not on *inter-departmental collaboration* or business partnership activities.\n\nFurthermore, the tool execution result explicitly confirms this interpretation: “The 'Levels of Analytics' chart does not explicitly identify four business cooperation activities. It describes a seven-layer pyramid of analytical capabilities, and no evidence in the provided context links it to business collaboration activities.” This aligns with the consensus across all citations, which uniformly state that the model is concerned with analytical process stages, not cooperative business functions.\n\nNo image or supplementary data was provided to contradict or supplement this finding. Therefore, there is no empirical or visual evidence supporting the existence of four business cooperation activities within the “Levels of Analytics” framework.\n\nIn summary, the “Levels of Analytics” chart is a model of analytical maturity, not a framework for business collaboration. The claim that it identifies four business cooperation activities is unsupported by the available materials.",
