They can also embody social issues, notably the concept of \"the elephant in the room,\" which refers to an obvious problem that is being deliberately ignored. This duality in representation allows for a nuanced interpretation of the elephant's role within the cartoon.\n\nGiven the absence of specific details from the cartoon on page 25, we can hypothesize that the elephant may symbolize a significant issue or theme that the cartoonist aims to highlight. For instance, if the cartoon portrays an elephant in a setting that suggests neglect or avoidance, it could be emphasizing a societal challenge that is widely recognized yet overlooked. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the elephant serves as a metaphor for pressing issues that require attention but are often ignored in public discourse.\n\nFurthermore, if the cartoon depicts the elephant in a more positive light, it could represent qualities such as wisdom or strength, suggesting that the cartoonist is advocating for the recognition of these attributes in the face of adversity. The specific context of the cartoon—such as the expressions of characters, the setting, and accompanying text—would further refine this analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of the themes being conveyed.\n\nIn summary, the elephant in the cartoon on page 25 likely represents a significant theme or societal issue, whether it be an ignored problem or a symbol of strength and wisdom, depending on the context provided within the cartoon itself. Further details would enhance this interpretation, providing clarity on the cartoonist's intended message.",
