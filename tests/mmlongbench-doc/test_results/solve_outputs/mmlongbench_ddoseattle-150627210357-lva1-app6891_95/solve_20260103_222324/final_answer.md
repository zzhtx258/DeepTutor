Furthermore, if the cartoon depicts the elephant in a more positive light, it could represent qualities such as wisdom or strength, suggesting that the cartoonist is advocating for the recognition of these attributes in the face of adversity. The specific context of the cartoon—such as the expressions of characters, the setting, and accompanying text—would further refine this analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of the themes being conveyed.
