It focuses on prescriptive analytics — answering “What should we do?” — and uses storytelling to provide context for decision-making. This stage bridges the gap between descriptive reporting (what happened) and actionable implementation (what to do next).\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Analytics Value Chain Flowchart (image)\n- [2] Analysis\n- [3] Analytics Value Chain",
