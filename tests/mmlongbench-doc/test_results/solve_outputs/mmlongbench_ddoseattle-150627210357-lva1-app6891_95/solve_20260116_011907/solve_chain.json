      "step_response": "## S1: Identifying the Stage Between 'Reporting' and 'Action' in the Analytics Value Chain\n\nIn the **Analytics Value Chain** flowchart, the stage that directly follows **Reporting** and precedes **Action** is **Analysis**. This stage serves as a critical bridge between descriptive insights (from Reporting) and prescriptive decisions (leading to Action). It focuses on answering the question: *“What should we do?”* — moving beyond simply describing what happened to recommending optimal courses of action based on data-driven insights [rag-1].\n\nThe full sequence of the Analytics Value Chain is as follows:\n\n1. **Data** →  \n2. **Reporting** →  \n3. **Analysis** →  \n4. **Action** →  \n5. **Value**\n\nThis progression reflects a logical maturation of analytics maturity: from raw data collection, through descriptive summaries, into diagnostic and prescriptive reasoning (Analysis), then implementation (Action), ultimately yielding measurable business value.\n\nVisually, this stage is often symbolized by an icon representing a document with a line graph under a magnifying glass and a lightbulb — signifying insight generation and decision-making [rag-1].\n\n### Summary\nThe stage between ‘Reporting’ and ‘Action’ in the Analytics Value Chain is unequivocally **Analysis**, which transforms reported data into actionable recommendations. This step is foundational for driving strategic decisions grounded in analytical insight.",
