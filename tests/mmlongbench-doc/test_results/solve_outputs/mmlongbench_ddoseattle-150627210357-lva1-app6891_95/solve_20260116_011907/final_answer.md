## S1: Identifying the Stage Between 'Reporting' and 'Action' in the Analytics Value Chain

In the **Analytics Value Chain** flowchart, the stage that directly follows **Reporting** and precedes **Action** is **Analysis**. This stage serves as a critical bridge between descriptive insights (from Reporting) and prescriptive decisions (leading to Action). It focuses on answering the question: *“What should we do?”* — moving beyond simply describing what happened to recommending optimal courses of action based on data-driven insights [rag-1].

The full sequence of the Analytics Value Chain is as follows:

1. **Data** →  
2. **Reporting** →  
3. **Analysis** →  
4. **Action** →  
5. **Value**

This progression reflects a logical maturation of analytics maturity: from raw data collection, through descriptive summaries, into diagnostic and prescriptive reasoning (Analysis), then implementation (Action), ultimately yielding measurable business value.

Visually, this stage is often symbolized by an icon representing a document with a line graph under a magnifying glass and a lightbulb — signifying insight generation and decision-making [rag-1].

### Summary
The stage between ‘Reporting’ and ‘Action’ in the Analytics Value Chain is unequivocally **Analysis**, which transforms reported data into actionable recommendations. This step is foundational for driving strategic decisions grounded in analytical insight.
