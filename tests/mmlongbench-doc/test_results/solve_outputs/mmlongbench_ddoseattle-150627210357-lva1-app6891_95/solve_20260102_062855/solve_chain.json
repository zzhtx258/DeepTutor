      "step_response": "## S1: Analysis of Hand-Drawn Cartoons in the Slides\n\nTo determine whether hand-drawn cartoons are present in the slides, we must first define what constitutes a “hand-drawn cartoon” in an educational or presentation context. A hand-drawn cartoon is a stylized, illustrative drawing—typically created with pen or pencil—that uses exaggerated features, expressive lines, and narrative visual elements to convey abstract ideas in an engaging, often humorous or simplified manner [rag-1]. This distinguishes it from informal annotations (e.g., scribbled notes on a whiteboard), technical diagrams (e.g., flowcharts), or digitally rendered infographics, which prioritize clarity and structure over artistic expression.\n\nThe available materials explicitly state that the visual components of the slides include: minimalist infographics, bar charts, flowcharts, whiteboard diagrams, dashboard interfaces, and photographs of office scenes [rag-1]. While whiteboard diagrams contain handwritten notes, these are described as *informal annotations*—spontaneous, functional markings made during explanation, not purposefully designed cartoon illustrations [rag-1]. Crucially, none of the described visuals exhibit the hallmarks of hand-drawn cartoons: no character designs, no narrative framing, no stylistic exaggeration, and no intent to anthropomorphize or symbolize concepts through illustrative storytelling.\n\nFurthermore, no image artifacts or visual files were provided or generated in this analysis, reinforcing that no illustrative cartoon imagery exists within the slide deck. The tool execution result corroborates this conclusion, explicitly stating: *“There are no hand-drawn cartoons in the slides... none of which qualify as hand-drawn cartoon illustrations”* [rag-1].\n\nThus, based on the definition, contextual description, and absence of supporting visual evidence, we conclude that the number of hand-drawn cartoons included in the slides is zero.\n\nThe slides rely on clean, professional visual aids designed for informational clarity—not illustrative storytelling through cartooning.",
