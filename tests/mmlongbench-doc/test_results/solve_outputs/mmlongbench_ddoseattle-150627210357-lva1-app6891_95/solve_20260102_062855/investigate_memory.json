The visual materials described include minimalist infographics, bar charts, flowcharts, whiteboard diagrams, dashboard interfaces, and office scene photographs — all of which are either digitally designed, professionally rendered, or captured as real-world work artifacts. While some images depict handwritten notes on whiteboards (e.g., iterative experiment cycles or collaborative brainstorming), these are informal annotations, not hand-drawn cartoons intended as illustrative elements in slides.\n\nNo content references stylized cartoon illustrations, comic-style visuals, or cartoonish depictions used within presentation slides.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] ddoseattle-150627210357-lva1-app6891_95.pdf",
