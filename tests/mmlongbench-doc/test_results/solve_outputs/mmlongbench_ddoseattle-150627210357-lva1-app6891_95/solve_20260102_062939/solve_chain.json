      "step_response": "## S1: Verification of Cartoon and Hippo Symbol on Page 25\n\nThe user’s inquiry references a cartoon featuring a hippo on page 25 of a document. To address this, we first verify the existence of such imagery based on the available knowledge and tool outputs. According to the provided materials, page 25 contains a digital dashboard visualizing data integration across departments through a Sankey diagram, which is a flow-based chart used to represent transfers or relationships between entities [rag-1]. Crucially, the description explicitly states that there is “no cartoon, hippo symbol, or any related imagery” on this page, and that the content is strictly analytical, focusing on data flow rather than symbolic or illustrative elements [rag-1]. Furthermore, no supporting images or artifacts have been generated or provided that would contradict this assertion.\n\nThis absence is consistent across all available evidence: neither the knowledge base nor any external tool execution yields any reference to an animal, cartoon, or symbolic representation on page 25. The notion of a hippo as a symbol—whether metaphorical, allegorical, or literal—is therefore not grounded in the documented content of the referenced page.\n\nIn summary, the cartoon and hippo symbol referenced in the question do not exist on page 25. The page contains only a technical Sankey diagram depicting data integration, with no illustrative or symbolic content involving animals.",
